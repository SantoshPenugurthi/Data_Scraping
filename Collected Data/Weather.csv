Thank you for your information but I have a question “you said that when there is tsunami 🌊 we should go to highest building” then which is the safest place to hide and rescue from the tsunami 🌊 ?
Hire a helicopter
"A slightly wrong point apart from wonderfull explanation. The orator was right that high building is not safe. But during tsunamis it is safe to reach highest point, like hill mountain etc"
Moon
Mountains are the safest place to hide
There is no safest place

Hi do you have a rain gauge at home. How much has it rained in Tirupati frm jan 2021 weather has been my passion since long I live in tpty would like to. Meet you. Any way you are doing a great job there are many from tamil nadu doing this. Were u part of kea weather blog remember seeing your name there. Please have a section for farmers especially during sowing and harvest times so that they plan there sowing and harvest. It will be of great help to them. Good luck and all the best.

"This is such a wrong demo video,  unbelievable that this video is used for educating young children's across the world as a benchmark for weather reporting, that too for the last 4 years without a single complain. How bizzare!  Where on earth do you find this crazy weather: Monday 72/51(22/10.5⁰ Celcius) Tuesday 77 (25⁰ Celcius) Wednesday 31 (minus -0.5⁰ Celcius) Thursday 56 (13.3⁰ Celcius) Friday 67 (19.4⁰ Celcius) Saturday 32 (0⁰ Celcius)  Where on earth you get to see these kind of temperature variation in 24 Hours? Definitely not in Chicago not even in Siberia  Chicago daily temperature deviation from hottest to the coldest averages between 6⁰-7⁰ Celcius and in Siberia it's 7-12⁰ Celcius  A demo should be realistic and practical and not random (whimsical), a temperature drop of 25⁰ Ç to minus -0.5⁰ C in 24 Hours as described in the video during Tuesday to Wednesday is near impossible and if that's the forecast than a very unusual and unnatural scenario is going to occur next day and no one is taking it seriously...  * Temperature very rarely (near impossibly) drops from 77 to 31 thats 25⁰C to minus -0.5⁰C even if we assume it did fall in between Tuesday-Wednesday but a rise to 19⁰.4 C on Friday is just IMPOSSIBLE Big fall does happens from +ve temperature to -ve but never the other way around...  Let us not load young pupils mind with such misinformation...  (Please check weather patterns of Chicago for the last 30 years and you'll know)  From India with 💙"

"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. (Joel 2:12-13) I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5)"

Edit for the title and not a good one? I'm sure on my post that only works with my post on reddit so that only makes me sad that is awesome and the most important things are awesome👍!

"Complete text: ""(Three, two) .. Good afternoon, I am Maria, from Chicago News. Let’s look at our weather for today. This morning it was cold and cloudy, but now it’s beautiful outside. Right now it’s 72 degrees. It’s sunny, nice and warm. Later tonight it will rain, and the temperature will go down to 51 degrees. And there’s more crazy weather coming this week. Let’s look at our five day forecast. Tomorrow, Tuesday it will be sunny and warm, 77 degrees, tomorrow. Then on Wednesday it will snow. The temperature will go down to 31 degrees, a pretty cold day. On Thursday there will be a big storm. Be careful it will rain a lot and it will be very windy. The temperature will be about 56 degrees. On Friday it will be a little windy and a little cloudy. The temperature will be 67 degrees. And on Saturday it will snow again. The temperature will be 32 degrees. Welcome to the crazy weather in Chicago.  Again I am Maria from Chicago News. Thanks for watching and have a good week."""

Hurricane ballbag
This video stunk
Why it’s mostly made of ships
I am new to this site. The extreme weather.
"Ship went to hurricane, man went to hospital."
"Isreal is responsible for all the weather changes they destroying the world in all different ways they brainwash the world with their false jesus, they want to own the world and killing people with everything possible but russia will deal with them"
"1 👁🚴‍♀ 🕸  simple concept basic logic if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper it's not. So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one's own soul and spirit for having lived and died to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today's people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today's people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial. S.R.F."
How will the world feel if ice on poles melt before we go there again? What if everyone feels better?
Did he say Hurricane Ballbag? 😂
Just stop with the annoying intros on each video. Just put the videos.
there is nothing extreme about UK weather

ماتم فرحته بطياره الاتكال ع الخالق اظن ابو شنب مايملك حلت الرجول ي ي ي بطل
Stuff like this is so scary and dangerest that i feel so happy that they made it alive!.  😂
Thanks to Allah 😊 I wasn't  there
1:00 My neck would be snapped
I’m surprised the big storm of 1987 in the UK isn’t mentioned here. The whole of the south west of the UK was affected with trees down and roofs of houses blown off. I lost a 300 gallon water tank which blew away NEVER to be seen again. I was without electricity for 3 weeks!!!!
The very first one. Did he say hurricane ball bag?
This is 90% stock footage and waffle and 10% actual content
I'm alive 🤲
Ummm does he know ships are made to be perfectly fine in up to 20 meter waves
these videos have so much uncessecary padding and editing
"And, really bored with all the ships in waves.  One season of Deadliest Catch and that's not interesting at all anymore.  and really sad that you cut off the glacier drops before the waves cover the land in front.  Makes them kinda ho-hum"
"Hahaha!!  I'm sorry - the captions on that first one - ""Hurricane Ball Bag""  hahahahaha"
"Lol, when youre sailing through seas so big the off course alarm is going off every 30 seconds."
Most look for long range weather forecasts before venturing out!
I'd been brave as hell and then through up all over the deck.
This is lame
The ice breaking up is both terrifying and beautiful at the same time but i have mad respect for anyone who works on the seas just looking at those gigantic waves got me with heart palpation
these are lameeeeeee
#12 is freakin nuts
hi
Hurricane Ballbag? Did I hear that right? 😄
How is a glacier calving a severe weather event?
This was boring.  Too much talking and pics of everything other than the severe weather that was supposed to be what the video was about.  🙁
hurricane bawbag hahha
Extreme AWW!
The ocean is so instinctively terrifying for me. All the boat videos gave me so much anxiety 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Enough with the warming BS!

Imagining my Viking ancestors sailing without all of the modern conveniences and being stuck in storms. Just wow.

dangerous storms.

"If any of you are nervous flyers, what they said about having no choice is rarely true. Here's how bad weather is handled IRL: if there is lightning or conditions deemed too dangerous for the crew to be on the ramp (runway/outside), they call a ground stop, meaning nothing in or out. If a plane is in route they will often circle for awhile until the conditions clear and it's safe again. This is enabled by the fact that planes are purposely filled with more fuel than they need for the trip. If the storm isn't going to clear and the ground stop is going to be too long, the plane will be diverted to a nearby airport (nearby in aviation terms. It's not always nearby in ground terms, but it's better than risking a dangerous landing). Landings like the one show in the video are attempted only under a few scenarios. If they're running too low on fuel, there's nowhere to divert to, or they're too far into their decent to turn back. It's extremely rare for those things to all happen at once and a dangerous landing is necessary.   Source: I'm almost 42 and my dad has worked in aviation since I was like 3 or 4. Specifically, he spent about 20 years working in operations control, and they're the ones that make these determinations about canceling flights, switching planes, ground stops, delays, etc. So I picked up a few things, especially during a for fun day we took to st Louis (we got free tickets and we hadn't been on a plane in awhile so he took us to stl and we hung out in the airport and went into the control tower so he could say hi to one of his friends and show us around. I wad like 12. It was awesome. We were really lucky and privileged to be able to do that.). He was very good about making sure we understood how it worked so we wouldn't be scared.   Also another tip if you're a nervous flyer: read the book Airframe by Michael Crichton. I know on the surface it looks like it would be the worst thing to read if you're scared of flying, but MC does so much research that it really teaches you how tough planes are. Like there's a scene where the MC is investigating the durability of stuff an it describes the testing of wing flexibility and that thing had to bend nearly double before it broke. So even tho it's fiction, it's more like using fiction to understand how planes work. I had a friend of mine who was terrified of flying read it and it helped her so much that when she got done with it she said ""holy crap I feel so much better that I'm gonna leave it on the plane for the next person to read so that they can feel better, too"". Trust me guys, if you're scared of flying and info helps you, read Airframe."
"Hello Kristina, How’re you doing?"
Get the facts on weather not globalist opinion.
I saw a sea animal in there not gonna lie
"Number 4 is computer generated, you can tell by the waves, it’s on a loop"
@Scott Anthony not interested in your fake account
@Amanda Boyce Nice to hear that you’re fine. It’s nice meeting you here😊 hope you don’t mind we get to know better?
@Scott Anthony fine
"Hello Amanda, How’re you doing?"
"The fear I have for this kind of storm, I can die of shock. The only water I trust is the one in a basin."
I like how they promote the phony global warming in this documentary. What they don’t tell you is that the Glaciers usually melt within the first six weeks in a year and this is normal. They’d like to make everyone think that there’s global warming. When was the last time you got bit by a mosquito in the winter? It was globalist Al Gore who started this global warming bull crap and now it’s become a trend. Some of these documentaries here on YouTube is designed to indoctrinate people to believe a false narrative. I don’t remember having 70 and 80° winters here in Chicago nor Wisconsin or anywhere else where it’s cold.
"Did he say ""hurricane ballbag""???"
That pilot is incredible!
"Ha ha Lutron airport…..love that! I live close to the sea,I’d love to know how you pronounce Happisburgh in the UK on the Norfolk coast!"
Full respect to everyone working on those ships ⚓💯🔥
7:25 even at 0.25x the lighting strike still looks super fast ! 🥲
As a Kiwi (New Zealander) I can attest to the crazy weather.  The winds are truly scary.  On some windy days people can barely walk forward.  It’s a beautiful place but it comes with frequent hurricanes and powerful earthquakes.
Is this narrated by Charlie Sheen?
I just saw a shark
If you wanna make comments just to more and more videos and you’ll get some more subscribers
"Hurricane ball bag? What was the next one named, hurricane nut sack?"

When did Charlie Sheen start narrating videos??
Pretty sure that shot of Everest was actually K2.
"None of the real 15 most extreme weather events are in this video. Lots of clips of ships in storms, though. Bizarre."
Global warming doesn't exist. 🤦‍♂️
Bru how many boat disasters are you gonna put.it specifically said “weather” not “boat” and I get it it’s scary in all an it is weather but I was expecting tornados but other than that good video
LUTRON Airport? I think he means LUTON
Wwwwwwwwoooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww
That’s crazy
Everyone told me it was “just a little ocean water splash” not a whole ass tsunami x tornado shit
lol hurricane BAWBAG lmao
so freking coll
13:30 biggest in Europe?!  How the he'll can it be the biggest in Europe when Russia is not even part of Europe and will never be part of it... 🙄🤦🤦
"Did he say Hurricane  Ballbag in the North Sea? Yep, that storm does look a complete ballbag. And later, did he say 'Lutron' Airport in London in the UK? I've heard of Luton Airport, but not Lutron. 🤣🤣"
#Pray.
How seasick can you become on a ship in a storm 🤢
NUMBER 13 IS SO TERRIFING
Hurricane ball bag?🫣🥹😂
"Yeah but too much talking. ""Air travel is undobtedly the most convenient, comfortable and quickest way to journey across long distances""... ffs bro, thumbs down"
"What would I have done if faced with Hurricane Ballbag ? I would have put on my survival suit, strapped into the lifeboat, bent my head as far down between my legs as possible, and then,       KISSED MY ASS GOODBYE. 🛟"
LOL. “Also known as hurricane bawbag”. Bawbag is Scottish slang for ball bag aka scrotum. Just about pissed myself laughing 😂
"Well, my pants would be in serious damage...😬"
"In the north, sea cyclone freighthound (also known as hurricane ballbag), pummelled everything in its path... I heard this correctly"
when he said he is subrised that people used to sail those seas back then lol back then the seas wernt as bad as now
That ice tsunami is one of the most beautiful thing I’ve seen💓

"Don't panic guys, global warming isn't actually real."
This looks really scary 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 😧😧😧😧😧😧😧
I would have been terrified!
That glacial triggered tsunami video was extremely stupid I hope the filmer got out of the way before the wave hit
Stop talking get to the adventure part
So scary!
You get used to it
Just come to Iceland and you will find these conditions many times a year and worse than these. :)
We work north east of Shetland. Gets pretty bad.
I live in portugal-
"What a disappointing video. I get it. Ships at sea experience extreme weather. But how does a video about the most ""extreme weather events caught on video"" not cover a single tornado? Nope, let's just cover more waves at sea apparently. Incredibly redundant and incredibly boring."
Your voice is soothing bro 🥶
Uk storm 2022 is really bad 😟😨
They were much worse 10 years ago
This is really bad
It gets much worse
Hurricane ball bag. Lol.
Bawbag? I was out in that.
"To Live, or Not to Live, That Is the Question  “To be, or not to be, that is the question,” mused Prince Hamlet in the so-called “nunnery scene” of William Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Every year, around the world, some 800,000 people answer this question negatively and take their own lives. Even worse, suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people. Why do people, especially young ones, take their own lives? Is it possible to strengthen their desire to live?  The authors of the Talmud wrote, “For two and a half years, the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel disputed. One side said, ‘It is better for man not to be born than to be born,’ and the other side said, ‘It is better for man to be born than not to be born.’ They concluded, ‘It is better for man not to be born than to be born, but now that he is born, let him look into his actions’” (Eruvin 13b). Indeed, if an alien were to land on Earth and look at us, it would probably say, “The pathetic humans bump into each other, ridicule and humiliate one another, and do everything they can to ruin each other’s lives. No wonder they are so depressed. Why did nature create such miserable beings?”  Suicide is the extreme consequence of a series of problems that afflict people to the point where they decide to end it all. But even before these problems become too much to handle, they make us ask about the meaning of life. After all, if life is only about survival through ordeals, then it is indeed better not to be born than to be born.  The thing is that when we begin to ask questions about life, or as the sages wrote, “look into our actions,” we begin to grow. Pain leads to spiritual development that lifts us to realms we would not have dreamed existed, and we would not have searched for them were we not forced by pain.  The key to these new realms lies in fostering positive connections among people, in emerging from the mindset of alienation and narcissism we have so devoutly nurtured until now, to find that when we sympathize with others, we gain rather than lose. We win new perspectives and new ideas, new wisdom and knowledge, and new friends. By changing our attitude to others, we change our world.  Moreover, by choosing who we bond with, we shape and reshape our world with every new acquaintance. In this way, no world is too harsh to live in, since we can always change the people we connect to, and in so doing, change our world. Also, there is no end to the insights and knowledge we can gain since there are always more connections to make than we can establish in our lifetime.  And best of all, when we connect with other people, we attune ourselves to our surrounding reality, which is already connected and would have worked in perfect harmony if we, humans, did not disrupt it. The more we develop positive connections, which aim to support and nurture rather than depress and oppress one another, the more we expand our perception of reality. We find that the reality we have known until now was only a “corridor” to a deeper and more expansive perception.  If we want people not to take their own lives, we must give them a reason to live. When people understand what life is for, they will have a purpose to go through life’s trials and tribulations. As Nietzsche wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”  Therefore, our task today is to reshape our connections in order to reshape our world. The world reflects our attitude toward others. If we jointly transform our attitude toward others from abusive and aggressive to considerate and caring, the lives of all of us will change, as well, from a losing battle to a smooth and pleasant ride. It is really up to us."
I agree with the cat guy
"We lost thousands of dollars of freight on the  New Zealand Wahine. Many lost far more. One powerful storm was moving south and got blown into the bight which narrows to eighteen mile wide, Cook Straight, and Wellington harbour. A second storm forced me off my bicycle in heavy rain and wind. It traveled north, pushing the big ferry into Wellington harbour. The two stormes clashed then and washed over the Wahine as it entered the closed twelve mile circle of high hills, a cauldron. Saving any lives was beyond expectation. Hero's went in and brought to shore, most aboard. I trained as a sailer,  knowing with my dedication I too could save others.  I navigated a Swiss seventy five foot steel ketch from Brisbane to Tasmania over ten days, Australia's bicentenary. Being the one who had the feel of her and sailed over fifty footers in seventy knots for ten hours without relief. I sat alone to recouperate then I saw the skipper ask for more sail. That would have knocked her down."
The Lisbon plane one got me crying so hard bc I’m going to Lisbon and I’m scared now someone comfort me 😭😭😭😭
I’m sure you’ll be on a different flight 😂
Did I hear someone wimpering at the end of that last one?  Wouldn't blame them...
PLEASE DONT FKING PUT MUSIC SO LOUTH IN A VIDEO
No music on my videos 😊 We film some of the largest waves ever caught on camera.  We work with 2 oil platforms that can accurately measure wave height so no guessing or exaggeration.  Enjoy 🌊🌊  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG-lkGl9kpwSEoYG5fJ3pwqVNZaDivv7z  And Meet the Crew   https://youtu.be/O8Kdw2b9cEQ
"#5 The NZ ferry. That video was shot in the entrance to Wellington harbour. At that point and in that wind I doubt they had room to turn the ship and head back into Wellington so it was out into Cook Strait, like it or not! Bet the onboard cafeteria didn’t make much profit that day. The ship was sailing just where the ferry ‘Wahine’ sank in 1968 with the loss of 52 lives."
Awesome videos!
This guy talks more than the videos!!!
What is the song playing quietly behind the video in the first 60 seconds?
Nice video :)
The ocean is fuckkng magnificent and terrifying
Yeeeet @ the first and last 7 minutes of a plane being the most dangerous eeeeeee!!
"What would I do, pray and speak to the storm. I have done that in the past over numerous dangers, and I found that Jeremiah 33:3 “ Call on Me, and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of.” God’s Word is powerful!  He desires for us to put our trust in Him."
"0:57 ""What would have *you* done, facing this?"" => *Shitting my pants!* (Idiotic questions deserves idiotic answers!) 😁"
Why does this guy narrate like the eejit form Police Camera Action?

Hurricane ball bag.. Nice.

This video could have been done in under 10minutes... so much unnecessary talking and information to drag out the time. Makes it boring.

Wow
Hurricane bawbag ....I'm so proud to be Scottish
"It is crazy when on camera, tsunami don’t look big. But in real life, you may as well die."
What would you do if you face something like this. What could you do. Run or what
BELIEVE IN JESUS! Only Jesus can save you. REPENT.
I experienced that also...i vomit alot because of up and down of the ship.its like its the end of my life ..but the capt of the ship is reàlly good to manage thatt kind of big waves.🙏
thats a glacier tsunami but actualy this is also called a glacier island getting created

"​@Bigwavemaster1 In Top Fives I clicked Videos. Considerable interest there, but am not seeing much about weather at all?"
It’s all on my channel 😊
Answering that first question: “what would you have done if you’d faced this?”   I’d have absolutely shit myself mate.
13:34 Russia is NOT and was NEVER europe...idiot!
All those ships going through storms and giant waves have made me seasick.  I feel pale and weak and slightly nauseated.  Thank god I never have had to experience this and never will.
I have worked on ships in weather like this
16:36 Is it Just me or does the Sichem Padua look much smaller in the video than in the pictures?
"Why do you call the runway the ""tarmac""? It's not tarmac. It's concrete. You just like the way ""tarmac"" sounds. Tarmac is low grade asphalt. It is not a runway. In the 1940s some airports ""apron"" (where the planes are parked) was made of tarmac. Any modern airliner would sink right through tarmac because it cannot support substantial mass. You people have one job...do it right or shut the hell up."
"Did he say, Hurricane Ballbag?"
not today
These so-called extreme weather events have been going on since the beginning of time you ever hear of the landmass Pangaea. Now that’s Extreme. It’s been going on for millions of years and will go on for millions more.
Hey. Here’s a little something for fun: https://youtu.be/07QbFxuixpI
So what even i was a captain of a ship in assasins creed..
So gnarly
Hesus what if that whole Icewall fell at the same time !

Whoever built that UK airport terminal should be sued out of existence.  Worst construction ever!
�� I WOULD OF BLEW CHUNKS ON MOST OF THOSE SHIP RIDES
There are no hurricanes in the North Sea homie

"Yeah, no joke I was in high sees on a cruise ship,  I'm a drummer playing a show , mind you all day was getting worse and worse,  so all of a sudden I literally flew over the fl. Tom dancers went off the stage, announcement every back to cabin ,so a lotta the crew went to crew bar to ride it out, that night I thought this was it,.!!!!!!!🤪 morning finally subside, to give u a pic in ur minds,waves hit the damn bridge, I don't know how high that was.whew!!!"
"I don’t really think these were the most severe weather events , I mean a crosswind at a airport instead of hurricane katrina for example…Now that was an extreme weather event , you should change the title or sumthin"
that background music  is super annoying
“What would you have done if you faced this?” Grab a camera and start recording because the camera never dies😌💅
Today we and my family is having a big storm 😭
And the ship got caught right in the middle of this....what would you have done if you were faced with this     Pass out like a lil beooootch lol 😆🤣😂
On ok Hi
I thought Charlie sheen was narrating this lol
Hurricane ball bag?
10:18 omg frickin scary!!!!
His voice is irritating?
"The earth goes through warming and cooling naturally,Antarctica, Greenland  has evidence of once warm and shows Greenland had plant life,so its natural and the theory of global warming is just a theory,with all the artificial islands  built, artificial  reefs AKA sinking ships,all the super tankers displacing water and still no evidence of rising sea levels,all I can day,say, using the ocean as a garbage dump."
10:55 “Lutron airport…” I died hahahaha
The narrator really sounds like Charlie Sheen
"Did he say ""Hurricane Ballbag""???"
First music was so creepy that’s all you can focus on👎
11:00 - There's NO such place in the UK as 'Lutron' Airport !... It's LUTON !
Glad I’m not the only one who noticed that. I had to rewind just to make sure I wasn’t mishearing!
"I was just thinking that, I got so confused as a Brit, had me thinking we unlocked a new area of the country like in a game 😂"
��😔💓
I am new
I just Love it when Chris Handsome narrates stuff on YouTube.  😂👏/s
I will sure be with my family
Depends on the hurricane hurricane Elsa? If yes I would love to hug my bff

Nature is reclaiming the planet and ridding the human parasite messing it up ☹️

No. 4 is a computer animation. Look at the sea waves. It is in a loop. And so are the weather formation.

Nice I found Charle Sheens YouTube channel!😆
My dads a strong man but if he died like this ima cry cuz im just thinking about that😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I would have been praying 🙏
I'm only liking this for the Hurricane Bawbag mention.
!?
Amazing how such a large and dense piece of ice can break apart❗️
Actually the ice is not dense at all.  As it moves down towards the sea it develops huge cracks that widen and split apart again and again and by the time it reaches the coast it is made of dirty ice pillars that are simply leaning on each other and not attached at all.  The collapse happens because the front is melted away from underneath by the (slightly) warmer water.  Since the only force holding it up is the fractured pillars once the first ones break off the ones behind are no longer supported and the whole thing crashes down into the sea.  It only stops when it gets far enough back from the edge to where the ice still has some cohesion and is solidly planted on the ground.  If you watch the video again you can see this happening as row after row comes down.
Global warming
I live in new your and there will be a hurricane and I am very scared I am 10 pls prank for me and my family and everyone else god bless you!!!😍😭😭😭😭
Amazing content..thank you for posting
Anyone else wondering who is filming the spectator pov of these ships?
#15 doesn’t look that bad.
Hurricane bawbag! 😂🤣 brilliant!  I love being Scottish!
Being out in big waves is truly frightening
@John Cullen I’ve been out in a few hurricane force winds and never seen anyone acting like that 😂 Where were they from?
I worked for a guy who had cargo ship friends. THEY told stories of being out at sea in monster storms; big strong men screaming and crying for their mothers like a 2 year old!
What would you do if you'd faced this?    What CAN I do I'm on a BOAT!!!
I would rather sacrifice myself because I’m so annoying even my family calls me Annoying
Keep going
"One time I was in like sponge docks I think it was and we went around shopping and stuff and the streets were flooded up to our knees, luckily it wasn't dangerous but it was pretty cool"

Did he just say hurricane Ballbag?
15:18  these storms are called supercells. they are the storms responsible for the creation of many of the violent tornadoes. they sometimes have mammatus (idk jow to pronounce it). these clouds are shaped like spheres and surround the supercell.
"LutRon airport!  Haha, so American.  It's LUTON airport in the UK. Pronounced Loo-ton. (If you ever have the misfortune to go there). Not exactly Changi."
"plz rename video to ""big waves"" thx"
Went head to head with a big wave in the navy. It was crazy to see the wave come over the flight deck
What's that song used on the background? I swear I heard that..somewhere..sometime

"Should be titled, Most Extreme Weather While Out to Sea Events Caught on Video."
Terrible
19:34  anyone see fish in this boat
extreme
Lutron airport? @10:55 Looks like somebody has neither travelled much nor watched British television extensively.
"I ain't religious but I bet after that aborted landing attempt, all those people on the plane were praying LOUDLY on the re-approach to that tarmac in Lisbon."
"My family are for many, many generations fisherman at sea. So many of them drowned  during storms. I have a love- hate relation with the sea and im scared of dark water. It's in my genes i think."
I took a cruise around Europe starting at Germany so we sailed throughout the Baltic Sea but there were no thunderstorms while I was there
Did he say hurricane Ball Bag?!?!?... 🤔😂😂😂
"I was on a puddle hopper flying into Dulles (VA, USA) years ago when we caught a wind shear. The wings did the wobble thing that plane did, except out wings touched (or it felt like it) and we ended up sliding down the runway wing first. I ended up on the floor with the seatbelt around my armpits. In that moment I truly understood the need for people to kiss the ground when they got someplace safely. It was a serious impulse I had to fight. Again years ago, my sister, her husband, and his daughter were on a small ship caught in a cyclone somewhere off the New Zealand Coast. Jacques tied my sister and his daughter to the mast as he navigated the ship in the storm. The ship did not capsize, but laid out 90° before going back upright. How everybody lived through that is beyond me."
Did he say “Hurricane BallBag”? Lol
I would start paying to Allah for help
hurricane bawbag as a scot this was so fucking funny
Too much talking on this video
Most excellent!
dude yall dumb its easy to survive. just don't die 🙄
The Sichem Padua is not the same ship that they show in the footage of the storm.

Is this Martin Sheen narrating this?
"Number 4 is unreal, look at the waves they have distinct repeating patterns and don't move up and down the beach like normal waves, unless going for a gif loop is what you're going for in these videos."
"Did he really say air travel is “comfortable”???  Must be a 5’2”, 125lb dude who only travels 1st class.  BTW, too boring to make it past the 1st 4 out of 15.  Much better vids on this subject out there."

Thank god for experienced sailors that know what they’re doing
10:15 that’s crazy
Imagine all the events that were not caught on camera. That's what I'd want to see!
"I think about this with everything, imagine the crimes / murders that go on that we have no idea about too"
There’s a few on my channel……but they were all caught on camera 😂

Especially when theve been engineering the weather sence Vietnam. Unfortunately the dark side of the military industrial complex uses the technology against humanity. Hopefully people are wasking up to the treachery with covid forcing them to remove the scales from their blacked out eyes and lien media propaganda they call media.
"OMG!! The last one was so intense, I almost got seasick!!  Great video!!"

Lutron Airport  LOL.
LOL hurricane BawBag
I will give this information to my friend he will appreciate it therefore I will pass it on
I like living in Kentucky
I would look in eyes of  fear on number15
Wow. Sounds like Charlie scheen  narrated
"I was going with my sad to our apartment outsider Malaga 2018, and the fog over Malaga was to thick so last minute before landing the pilot aborted it and we took off again like crazy. It was really scary. We we’re really close to the ground and we couldn’t see anything at all. Then we flew in circles over the city for like 20 minutes. Grateful for the pilot, he did so good, and he was super fast to explain what was happening. Otherwise a really great flight"

"Man, I came close to getting seasick watching that fishing trawler going up and down through those huge waves."
"Ok so this is not as bad as these videos but this is a really creepy story. So in Auburn WA 2:38 am there was crazy wind... all of our garbage bins were flying all over the place and they were full!!! Then we went to drive around my whole neighborhood and there are lots or separate Neighborhoods owned by the same community and then crazy wind blew across then cyan color lights flashed on the power lines, then here comes the creepy part... so all the power went out in all of the houses then 5 seconds later all the houses began flashing non stop for about 1 minute. As me who saw that in person Wes really creepy like someone was litterly controlling the power in every house. And I put the pedal to the metal on my car rushing out to my house... ngl that was the creepiest thing I saw out of 12 years of living in my community."
5:15 just imagine if you built a home in that gap to protect you from white walkers & you woke up to your home smashing on down.. how terrified would you be?
What an incredibly amazing pilot on that second one. Jesus that took some heart and fight to save that plane that low and circle around to try again. Amazing!
"Yes we can all agree a go around was in order.  These are not uncommon, but the approach in this case was terrifying."
I think #4 Pensacola Beach
Yet you forgot to leave the links down in the description.
I would have turned around and sailed to the nearest island.
What rubbish clips these are. The first one is so lame.
The glacier Tsunami was so cool
This why I don’t miss with the ocean. Imma stay on land.
"The commentary on this is so bad, where is Lutron airport? There is a Luton airport. The uk weather service is the Met office, short for meteorology, pronounce met as in bet, not M.E.T.  and what's with all the adverts, 6 in a 20 min film makes it unwatchable especially since they interrupt at the most ridiculous moments."
Did he say Hurricane Ballbag?
"The overjoyed dog reportedly blot because bush ultrasonographically crawl below a better dresser. erratic, irate dragon"
0:49...did I hear that right?? Did they call it “Hurricane Ballbag..?” 😂😂😂
"If these are the 15 most EXTREME weather events caught on video that you found, you aren't looking very hard."

"Yeah, it's more like ""10 rough seas, 2 calving glaciers, and 3 miscellaneous events caught on camera"""
Lol
he did say hurricane bawbag ? lol
This is scared a little
So scary
I am pretty sure that's the iceberg aang was in at 4:24
Hurricane Ballbag?
"Did I hear that right, hurricane ball bag?😂"
Wooooooooooooshshshshshshsh
ships have only been traveling for centuries? somehow I doubt that.
I will cry because i don't want to die
4:30 is nuts!
"What would you have done if you have faced this? Me: I would've probably pooped my pants to another demension, cry, aaaaand...scream 🙂"
"Sideways waves are horrifying to watch. I'd cry, puke and pass out at the very least."
Seen the ships navigate themselves through the storm gave me anxiety. 😭😭  Lord Protect all those ppl that work in ship.
"@Jeff Vader I'm pretty sure the author isn't doing anything wrong. If praying doesn't work for you, then don't do it. As you ask me to stop telling you what to do then DON'T tell the author what to do either, they are free to pray if they want to and that shouldn't concern you. Have a good day!"
"@Angie Arévalo I can't stop myself from helping when I hear people say stupid things so, you do you and stop telling me what to do. I'll help where I can."
"@Jeff Vader Friend, you do you and let the author of the comment do them"
Yes pray to God to protect those ships that are battered by severe weather created by the same god. Makes so much sense. Praying won't help anyone.
Bless you God 19mterry you got strong Heart
خالص احترميtankuo
What would you have done if you'd faced this?  died.
I legit said “idk cry I can’t do anything”
You go out and face it again.
��🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
You wouldn’t be the only person
That pilot goated
Kiss my backside goodbye. Surely that's why you have radios on ships to hear about the weather.
pfft I've seen much worse videos.. rename this to top lamest videos
Just land it's not that hard.
Ngl I don’t do airplanes in general but if that happened I’d be done nahhh
Background music is suicidal
"Yeah, gotta work that global warming thing into any talk about weather. So NO THANKS to your vids, bye."
Charlie Sheen???
I was a cook on an Army LSV. The struggle is very real.
reason they survived : they had a camera
"Yea sure, flying isn't the safest way to travel just because of the chances of wrecking. If you wreck in a plane, there's a 99.99% chance you won't survive, so how is that the safest? Give me a break."
"OK, I'll admit. I had a little fun with this absurd video. The title should be, ""15 Somewhat Interesting, but Perfectly Routine Natural Events that Happen ALL-THE-TIME"" Icebergs falling off glaciers!, 30 foot ocean waves, airplanes landing in crosswinds, thunderstorms with lightening, waves hitting a seawall, a fishing boat facing typically big waves and in no danger, a leaking ceiling getting nobody wet, a ship in a storm, wind on a mountain, a ferry in rough seas, an interesting looking cloud, routine iceberg calving from a glacier, a southern ocean storm. Yeah, alarmists annoy me and inaccurate statements annoy me. Statements the talker said that aren't true: 1. 16 foot waves from icebergs do not ""Destroy everything in their paths"" in fact in the glacier's bay they don't destroy anything at all! They get the rocks wet. That's about it! 2. Airplanes do not ""bear the full brunt of weather"" At altitude and in the air, they're fairly insulated from most of the effects of weather. 3. Airport restaurant customers ""had nowhere to go and simply had to endure"" the leaking ceiling. Ahh... yes they did have somewhere to go! Nobody is there! Nobody is getting wet! 4. The boat was ""forced to take the waves head-on."" Ships always take waves ""head-on."" It isn't safe to wallow sideways in large swells! 5. ""Due to its position on the bottom of the world New Zealand experiences some of the hardest weather conditions of any country."" Not true. There is nothing unusually severe about New Zealand's weather. 6. New Zealand's InterIslander Ferry customarily delays or cancels passages if the weather is too severe. The weather depicted was not severe enough to cancel or delay the ferry trip, although the waves may have been ""uncomfortable"" for the passengers. You can observe that the ferry is handling the conditions with aplomb - no problem! 7. The Sichem Padua oil tanker ""tilting"" 40 degrees, is not ""almost capsizing."" In fact it is designed to be able to list as much as 40 degrees. That doesn't make it easy to walk, but neither is it about to capsize. And the initial video is NOT of the Sichem Padua. The ship in the storm is actually the Sichem Padua and is completely different. 8. The completely routine process of glacier calving an iceberg is not a ""glacier collapse."" 9. Said of Patagonia, ""at such a southerly position it is extremely cold around the coast."" Not true. The temperature extremes of southern Patagonia - high: 76.1 and low: 28.4 °F. Not exactly ""extreme."" Actually, you could say those temperatures are quite mild! 10. The waves emanating from icebergs calving from glaciers do not ""cover everything in their paths, including any boats that may be there at the time."" No, the waves very quickly result in nothing more than a mound in the water over which any boats can easily ride over. The only danger is being immediately next to where an iceberg calves. A more practical danger is getting bombarded by chunks of ice blasted by the rush of air emanating from a calving."
"Jesus is coming soon  Jesus is the only savior and judge  Psalms 50chapter  15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Glad I'm NOT there in any of those situations. Amazing that we can witness those events through camera. Safe behind the screen. 🤗

"If I was facing force 12 winds on a bofart scale I'd just move the dial back to like a 7 on the bo-fart scale.  WTF?  12 on the bofart scale?  How about hurricane winds of 200 mph or even kph, that might mean something to most people watching.  12 on the fart scale doesn't mean shi#, excuse my french and the pun.  But I got a good laugh that I didn't expect out of this.  I had to look it up, good old Francis Beaufort in 1805.    The winds actually reached a 0.12 on the snodgrass scale.  Hate to say it but it sounds like something out of a Monty Python skit."
"Once when my little cousins were visiting us, we took them out of a boat ride (we owned a boat) and there was a hurricane. Those kids mom’s have never been more scared 😂😂😂"

��and⚡made it🌫to a🌪
for the first one i would just keep the ship running but no acceleration and i wouldn’t turn unless i had to and i would keep it head on with the waves
People who go into waves that big have balls of steel.

"Wisdom. Probably hard-earned, but true."
"The earth cries out to the Lord Jesus Christ to be free from the bondage of death. The wages of sin is death and it has affected everything and everyone in this world.  Jesus Christ loves you everyone! He died on the cross, was buried, and rose again on the third day to save YOU ALL from your sins.  Every man is born a sinner. Sin is in the hearts of all mankind. All sins lead to death and Christ paid the penalty for them.   Believe and trust in what Jesus Christ did for you today. Salvation is now my friends. If you ONLY believe in what Jesus Christ did for you then you will be saved and given eternal security. You will be made right and have peace with God.    Don’t wait until it’s too late. God is waiting for you to accept His one and only Son Jesus Christ for your sin debt."
Oh shit
Charlie Sheen commentating now? Anyone else notice his voice?... just me?. Ok
This video was so terrible
Hurricane Bawbag🤣🤣🤣
"#5   Contrary to the commentary, the weather around New Zealand generally is no rougher than any other part of the world.   However Cook Strait (where the ferry was filmed) is notorious for generating occasional big storms, even when the rest of the country is experiencing normal weather. I think the ferry was the Aratere  ('Ara-terreh'), not Aratea."
#8  Where is Lutron airport??
Hello Great
"Real debate, what's scarier? Being on the ocean, being high in the air, or being in space"
#4 is friggin! AWESOME !
"I agree, it was amazingly cool!"
"Jesus is the son of God. Who died on the cross for our sins. Our sins land us in eternal separation with God, which is hell. God is loving, but he is just and righteous. God didn't want any of us to go to hell. The punishment for sin is death and it must be payed in full. So Jesus willingly took the punishment of every single sin man has done upon himself, God poured out his anger that he had for our sins on Jesus, since Jesus was taking the punishment. He died, but he rose again.  The bible doesn't say you need to go  church,  have holy communion or do good things to go to heaven. Our righteous acts are like filthy rags to God (Isiah 64:6). We can't enter his kingdom with SIN!  Actually you need to believe and have faith in the lord Jesus, that he died for our sins and rose from the dead. You must repent of all of your sins and turn away from them. read the word of God which is the bible, and don't merely listen, but obey them. (James1:22) the scriptures also help you overcome your sins as well as praying..  In other words put Jesus first  This is how you get saved  Believe in Jesus.  J E S U S  L O V E S  Y O U"
Wow some people who are dumb there hobbies need to be mine.
"As a Royal Navy veteran seeing these ships in rough weather brought back many memories! Been through my fair share of that, the only positive, there was never a queue at meal times but whether you could eat it all without having to wear it was all part of the fun!"
Wow! God bless you thank you for your service!
@Arfa Barmcake I wonder if the person above who asked for your Service history doubted you! ..He hasn't acknowledged   your replies. Even I {as a Landlubber} have heard of a couple those Ships you Served on.

0:48 did he say also known as hurricane ballbag?  or is that just my ears lol

That is the shore and that is a person walking I believe
I live in New Zealand and being in a boat especially the interislander boat technically scary to be in the interislander boat during the storm you can become seasick or you can find it hard to stand up and walk around

Out there, a 438ft 4000 ton ship is about LESS than a cork in a bathtub. that last naval shot was a hurricane bow cutting through a 50/60ft wave. makes an entire ship shake bow to stern. the laughter was relief from surviving that wave!"

"I agree with u,I’m even terrified of flying now with planes disappearing it’s scary now. But I’m more scared of the ocean I can swim but not strong against tsunarmi or sinking shipping safer on dry land away from the sea"

The Sichem Padua in the first scenes and the one caught in the storm look like two different ships. It's a lot smaller and less flat on the surface.
0:48 Did he say Hurricane Ball Sack?????
Half of these are just rough seas lol.
I hate to tell you but those seas are not unusual. My husband was a commercial crab fisherman up in Alaska and they had those rough seas.
0:57 just enjoy the ride
The first thing up is a tanker in big seas where they say there is no land in sight but there is either another boat or a oil rig off of their starboard side.
Yea you tube sux now
Fantastic photography what a shame about all the advertisements
What would I do? Pray to Jesus! He has experienced a storm while in a boat and He fell asleep. The disciples had to wake him up🥰 He got up and rebuked the storm. And probably went back to sleep😆

15:17 Formation by Beyonce IMMEDIATELY started playing in my head XD
Absolutely fake.
"First of all, ships in storms aren't ""forced to take them head-on""  That's the way any vessel approaches a large wave, is head-on. Or to be more correct, ""slightly"" head-on. The best course is to head into the waves at a bit of an angle, which increases the roll of the ship but reduces the up and down pitch somewhat. This is always the safest method, because rolling over the waves at a direct head-on means the ship is coming over the highest crest of the wave, and then plunging into the deepest part of the valley which is never a good thing. The high pitch going over the wave head-on and then the sudden drop into the bottom of the swell can be very bad. Another bad thing you can do is to be in a ""following seas"" position during a storm. The only worse thing is to have the wave pass under the ship sideways, (the crest of the wave in line with the keel of the ship). If the waves are tall enough, that's when the ship is in the most danger of capsizing (Broaching).     And before anyone accuses me of being a keyboard warrior, I served 20 years in the US Navy. I have been in plenty of rough seas, The most memorable time was in the mid-1970s when we went through the Taiwan straits in the middle of a typhoon. We were in 80 foot seas on a 600-foot long ship. You might think a 600 foot ship is big, but you don't really know till you've been in a typhoon, it seemed pretty damn small at the time. There was ""green water"" (Actual waves, not just spray) coming over the flying bridge, Which is the highest part of the ship not counting the masts. (And I have pictures from the bridge portholes to prove it). The flying bridge (The ""signal bridge"", which is the next deck up from the actual bridge) was 70 feet above the waterline. We took rolls in excess of 50 degrees and pitches near that, there were footprints halfway up both sides of the passageways bulkheads because of people trying to stay on their feet. We stayed at general quarters (Battle Stations) for three days.  Needless to say, no one ate much during those three days."
Who narrates this? Sounding a bit like Charlie Sheen or is it just me?

God is amazing. A constant reminder of His power and mercy are these weather events and his preservation of many involved.
So he dishes out less mercy in the weather events that take the lives of hundreds of thousands?
Don’t test and play with Mother Nature. She always win

Supercell tornadoes even more dangerous then a hurricane.

Baltics attached to the atlantic? North Sea and the English channel says no.
If I faced that hurricane on that ship the first thing I'd have done is pee in my pants.
Wow

Imagine being on a sail ship back in the 17th-18th centuries on wooden sail ships out in those waters caught in hurricanes
Yo what song is this?

Wow!!!!
Like id never ever want to be on a ship or a boat because the ocean is my biggest fear like imagine my head went let’s go on a boat then on that same day on the boat I could hear a siren saying either hurricane or tsunami 🌊😧  What would u do 🙈?

Don't any of you know how to use modifiers properly in a sentence? Or to use plural pronouns?  I am so tired of reinterpreting your lousy sentence structure. Take an english course would you?  I learned this stuff in 5 th grade.

0:57 I'd have gotten sea sick.
wow  wow
Is it weird that I got motion sickness from watching the first video????
"I was serving in the USNavy back in 1976.  I was stationed on a ship's tender. Typhoon Pamala was hitting the South Asian areas we were in. We were on our way to Guam when we had no choice but to get thru this storm. Next, our Captain let us all know we were getting close but going around the eye, double-check again, secure everything again.  I being from California, I have never thought of or imagined what it is like to go thru a Hurricane and now going thru a Tornado. We experienced 7 Water spouts within the Typhoon, surrounding us and closing in! We in this big strong warship being tossed side to side, up and waaaaay down. The screws(propellers), would come out of the water and when they hit back down we shook like an earthquake knocking all over even if it was securely locked down properly. It was hard to hang in there!  WOW, what a frightful adventure! And I been a survivor of 4 of them in 4 years."
”Hurricane Ballbag”?!  Hahaha
Which Hotel? What beach?. Sloppy work.
Lutron Airport? There's no such city in the UK.
Mount Everest is not on Russia that's in Nepal

really? this is your list?
Good editing and commentary but we have seen much worse weather events on channels of lesser quality. Ya'll are not using your skills to the best of your ability. Guess everything is copyrighted now. At halfway point so I guess I'll keep watching. L8r.
That oil tanker the padua or whatever .The pictures in calm weather are different ship entirely look at the feature on the deck the pictures are of a super tanker same colour wrong ship i do wish they would be accurate .
Hurricane ball bag are you having a laugh
Hold on hold on so the first one said it was on December 2011 well I was actually born on 2011 in December OMG
Amazing yaaaaaar.  Very nice and terrible video.
/// ;pl
Dude said hurricane “ball bag” 😂😂 equivalent to cyclone nutt sack 😂😂
4:41 the green part of the ice am I the only one seeing it?
The first one did he say hurricane baw bag?
Is Charlie Sheen narrating?
WOW! Bless the cargo ship captains that have to deal with bad weather at sea
Thank you very much 😊
EXTREME GLACIER COLLAPSE!! *2 Ice cubes drop*
"I sailed for the Navy and the US merchant marine for 44 years.  Your depiction of large ocean-going  ships in  storms, where little white water and no green water comes over the bow, is laughable.  The seas seen in your clips are common and routine."
Got any better videos to check out for ships in storms?
15:40. Dude that's a supercell.
"no 8,airport , we do not need storm for that efect,it's normal when english builders do something."
Dood why you cut the wave from that ice short?  booo wanted to see the rest
Why cut it off at 6:23? That person recording  would  have been dead for sure

Good lord the fuckin ADS. I know they are necessary for the monies but I definitely gave up watching (despite being very intrigued with the video) because of the sheer number of them. Obnoxious.

None of these were that amazing
This video weeaak
Just imagine the ones you don't see..
Dude! You're freaking me out
Man the waves on number 1
Lutron airport? Luton*
Hurricane ballbag 😂😂😂
it'd be great if you could add metric measurements as well.  thanks !
Gosh the storms 30 ft waves & the thunderstorms in the Baltic Sea R definitely the scariest things imaginable I really don’t know what I would in the face of these horrific instances ! Do whatever it takes 2 get thru alive all while praying 😅
So England had 1 million dollars worth of damage from Imogen? LOL florida has 16.2 BILLION on average... per year.
"I’ve seen way more extreme and interesting ones, this one is more like ‘random wind videos’ 👎"
It's not the most extreme but it definitely is one of the most realistic and clear ones.
lmao that storm imogen footage is just a normal on a British seafront... could see that in Scarborough anyday
What would I have done? Shat in my pants.
What an appallingly crass commentary. Do you think your audience are retarded 5 year olds?
Are you the guy from simple history??
"@0:48 ""Which was also known as hurricane Ballbag"" That's nuts!"

"you dont really wanna take waves head on.. take them with some angle.. and eases the boat and ur stomach 35' ers aren't to terrible its the 50' plus that gets scary  and no need for full throttle, just enough to manage control and steer/tiller your boat"
I thought he said it was called hurracain ball bag in the first video 😂😂
There's no global warming.
"there is no such thing as a storm force 12, get your facts right..."
"5:22 that's when i wound've stopped recording, and started running."
Stupid Video...Seen Better.
Seen better on where?
"Maybe actually do Top 5s because the intros are too long and and some of the items are not that impressive, especially for those of us who have experienced them."
What would you have done if you were caught up in it?   Uhhh...throw up a lot.
"LUTON,  not Lutron. Xx"
I think the most extreme water evenT EVER is when u get sprayed by a mega squirt gun
If I’m in the ship I’ll shutdown my engine and wait until the storm passes
Did that ship make it. I would have eather avoided it or full throttle.
"I've seen more extreme things happen in my backyard. Rename video to ""Mild Weather Events Caught on Video"" please"

Hey! The guy that's narrating this is the same one that narrates Simple History!
@Kim North true
It sounds like Charlie sheen
it is so bad😶😐
The people standing close to the edge of the water during those waves from Storm Imogen make me cringe. Have they never seen someone get dragged out to sea from a wave they underestimate?! Gah! 🤦🏻‍♀️
"Can honestly say that if I'd have been in Cornwall during Imogen I'd never have felt at risk at all. Nevermind at ""Lutron"" airport in the UK where I'd probably have been laughing. How these are the top 15 anything I have no idea."

"Here we'll show 15 of the most extrememe weather events.....but first, a quick essay.....what IS weather?....."
0:59 shit myself what?
"Want to know about Truth, Reality + what our lives are all about. The ARK of the COVENANT has been found in Jeremiah's Grotto, right under where YESHUA=Jesus was crucified. So HIS BLOOD + WATER that came out when He was stabbed by the spear could run down the crack in the bedrock, that happened when the earth quaked + landed on the correct side of the ARK, that was placed there many hundreds of years earlier. His dried BLOOD was still alive even, + tested as only having 24 CHROMOSOMES = Virgin Born + proving HIS DIVINITY.. (only had one parent= regular 46, which is 23 chromosomes each) + with only one male Y chromosome from the Father. - PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8TRoQk6WUE @ (41:41) = HIS Blood is STILL ALIVE + had only 24 chromosomes = 23 from his mother + only One from His Father (normal people have 46 = 23 from the mother + 23 from the father). If these videos have been taken down, then in YouTube search these words = ( ark of covenant blood Ron Wyatt ) - Sorry guys + gals, but the higher up elite of mankind has decided to believe + side with these aliens (fallen angels + Nephilim) = sons+daughters of the children of fallen angels + human females in building these particle colliders - which mess with our timelines. -  Isn't it amazing what knowledge we can gain by simply adding the “il-s” of life, into this evil theory.,, EVil-sOLUTION. Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there is only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water. - WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don't try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years. - DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early '90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don't know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc  - Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel 1:16), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. ""a wheel in the middle of a wheel"" or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly? - This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys, when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once. - + Don't you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current. - This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor. - THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/ is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ http://free-energy.yolasite.com/ Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity. - This is a diagram https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php that looks a lot like the wiring of this former “science experiment” YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery.  - PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/ + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages. Or even better, convince the government to start generating it for us, getting rid of the pollution that we put into the air, and the radioactive stuff completely. - Have you ever heard of the MANDELA Effect? PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT,,,, + then try telling me that there is not a POWERFUL SPIRITUAL WARFARE going on in our world. This is a must watch video. All of time and space are changing. Things that are true have been altered + CERN is the cause for these events. They are trying to prevent His 2nd Coming, + they have already delayed it. http://2020-vision.yolasite.com/ - Here is one of the videos trying to let this scary information out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPrutcbaerQ&list=PLDIEv5nkqqEa0-u8DIzqpefKBAG0nkb7g&index=1 - + here is an explanation by the Physicists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHKmoBeNWWQ&list=PLDIEv5nkqqEa0-u8DIzqpefKBAG0nkb7g&index=2 - + here is a radio speaker's view on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v19n5JBSDs&t - CERN Is Changing Our Timelines – Proof - Mandela Effect Part 1 Our Father, Who Art in Heaven, had set up a Door = deadline for His Son to come back by/before + it has the Quantum computer http://doorschristmustpassthrough.yolasite.com/ but that Door has already past = JAN 14.57, 2019 = 1st DOOR + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooZA0riSa9Y tells you what is the real story.

"I was a squid during Nam . We were on a West Pac cruise in early to mid October . We stopped in Yokosuka , Japan for 2 or 3 days then made our way toward Subic Bay , R.O.P. I was aboard a DLG (a light destroyer with 12 foot Titans ) . On that portion of the cruise we encountered 3 Typhoons that seemed to feel as though we were invading it's territory . I stood on the Bridge and looked aft . It was as though the ship had 2 distinct halves . I clearly saw the ship twisting in the middle , both halves twisting in opposite directions at the same time . It was quite an experience . One I'm sure I'll not forget any time this century ."
Please tell us some subic bay stories 😉😍

"Seeing the ships navigate the storms safely, it makes me truly understand why ships and boats are treated with respect and almost reverence, and why sailors are superstitious about them."
@joe m Thank you for your service!
Cringey comment
@DROSS GAMES & SPORTS Nope! The amount of comments I’ve seen about sailors during a storm terrified & praying……😂😂😂
Sailors aren't superstitious about boats buddy.
Can’t say that I’ve known many superstitious sailors.
You have one extreme video on here and only spent like 15 seconds on it describing it wasn’t fake.
"19:00 there is a girl behind laughing and enjoying the waves with some others , but you disabled their audio =) Just so it looks more scary and not giggling xD gj"
He disabled the audio? Then how did you and I both hear it?  It sounds and looks more like he slowed down the video/audio.
"The period of time just at the end of the Younger Dryas shows mankind a huge increase in the level of the oceans.  A great deal of ""new"" water for the oceans of earth.  That period has been called the ""climatic optimum"" on earth AND there was a lot less ice .  I see NO climate change that threatens us, rather makes the planet better for people and critters."
"Asking Gail; why when I asked about an 'in stock' Encore grinder which I bought as a birthday gift (time sensitive) not shipping in over 5 days, I got two responses.. 1) ""Sarah, we need to cancel this order"", and 2) ""oh, those are out of stock until 10/16 (3 weeks after I ordered). The day I complained it was still listed as ""in stock and delivering in 7 days"" on the website.  So I took the advice and cancelled, and I bought from Amazon the next day and it is here tomorrow. Gail, why?"
2:19 when you are a alcoholic but you're trying your best
��😂😂😂😂😂😂
"lol...he said global warming , do some research and call me back  ? LOL.."
"Måste ni amerikanare jämt prata, vi vet ju vad vi ser. Ni tycks älska er egen röst mest av allt?"
Who names these storms? Hurricane BALLBAG!? Ahaahaa. Nice one.
3:49 .... Different breeds man... couldn’t be me out there
Bra if I could fly while I was in a hurican in a ship on sea I'd fly for it
No you wouldn’t
lol imagine thinking us brits don’t have bad storms. the south complain bout em but us northerners stick our big coat on
"After the 4th ship video I started skipping...There are more extreme weather events than storms at sea, just sayin'."
Stand by me narrator? Though I would never see him again. . .
Please stop eating meat and dairy.
#4 is an app for animating pictures
15.00 minutes. 20 foot waves and 65 mph winds. In Scotland that's a good day to dry your laundry on the bridge wing! Leaking windows at an airport must have been terrifying. So extreme.
The first looks fake but also real I can’t tell
i would have a sub as a rescue vehicle in these conditions
Sooo many ads..... couldn't watch 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
"@00:59 ""what would you have done if you had faced this?""  Umm, do we all look like sea captains around here?? How the fuck would we know??  Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer."
"No tsunamis? There were two major tsunamis caught on film in the last 20 years and you got neither of them but like 30 different ocean stores which are essentially the same thing, big waves in the open ocean. And no tornadoes either? Might as well be a top 15 ocean storms"
THIS
is this the simple history guy??
Yep!
04:47
Horrible video
I'll no longer view this channel considering there are almost as many ads as content.
"I didn't get any ads. But if i would have, the ads prolly be more entertaining 😂"
15:41 that's all I wanted to see 🙄
Sooo bad music doesn't even match the scenes
Too bad with the background music ruining the sound of the breaking glacier
This video was disappointing.
bruh tf bro. y so many boats not enough tornados and deathh
Top 5 made a video about 15 things
I like the content and I have one thing to mention and couldn't let go. GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT A NATURAL PROCESS! IT IS A RESULT OF HUMAN FOOLISH ACTIVITIES
Hurricane ballbag 😂😂😂
"Winners lose much more often than losers. So if you keep losing but you're still trying, keep it up! You're right on track.  -The Shades"
Getting approached by a storm?  Just say no! Mother nature legally cant destroy your life without your consent
"Geeze what a scary video. Not going to Portugal by plane or sea anytime soon. Mountain climbing sounds & looks like a TOTAL bore. Don't see why anybody could like that, besides freezing your ass in the snow under some avalanche. Nausea watching those ships in storms. There's nowhere safe on the planet."
"Google or look on tiktok for videos of Utah’s wind storm from 9/7-8/2020, we are an inland state but had hurricane s strength winds and it was badddd"
why is everything on a slo mo?
I watched the whole thing just to see the phenomenon in the thumbnail pic and didn't see it. Fooled by clickbait again!
@Ryan Molstad Molstad? Is that a town between Lelystad and the Randstad?
"c'mon man, its very clearly PS'ed"
Yep ..me too mate.
"and that's how many times now? ....fool me once, etc. C'mon! It's YT"
at least I got some video with my ads
i would simply tell the hurricane to stop❤️
#10  wtf cut away before waves gets to rocks
The only woman who can reek havoc wherever she wants  in the world and get away with itl.mother nature
is it just me or does the narrator sound like Charlie Sheen?
Not just you
I'm done
Is that Charlie Sheen narrating?
The shear number of midroll ads completely ruins any immersion I have
Umm I think the first one was a rouge wave
Lmao the first one... Hurricane bawbag. Not actually a hurricane. Just playfully named that by us Scots. Was a wee bit I a windy day someone called it hurricane bawbag over the radio and the name caught on. Bonus points for any youtubers that knows what it means 😂
"“Lootron airport” in the UK, also known as Luton airport 😳"
0:56 What would i have done? I'dve shit my pants thats what.
I know that cameras 📸  do not reflect the real magnitude of the waves... when you are on the ship 🛳 waves 🌊 are actualy feell and are 10 story building high. Thank you for the upload.
Too many adds.
I lived in newyek
Narrator sound just a little bit like Charlie Sheen to anyone else?
I never want to do Any of those things
*calls mommy to save me*
Hurricane Bawbag 😂
Wow
Amazing 👍👍👍👍
"Too much misinformation, too much  mispronunciation. Do your research.  Terrible narration."

"Started enjoying your video, but the 4th Ad interruption not even half way through was enough of an irritation, I was done. Thanks anyway."
"Great watch, but your Mt. Everest footage is actually K2."
K2 is much harder than  Everest.
PRAY !  PRAY !! PRAY !!!!!
What would i have done Pray
20 ads. Super annoying
Charlie Sheen you can do better than that.
"Jesus christ with all these ads, there are more ads than the actual video"
Heh no swears
"@Socially Awkward Guy and you can still install it, good bye troll."
david wilegus that’s because you already have it installed
@Socially Awkward Guy uh what? My ad block works just fine.
david wilegus it’s patched
WELL I’M OKAY BUT I’M NOT SURE HOW MUCH YOU PAY TO BE IN A LOT BUT YOU DON’T WANT ME GOING BACK AND THEN I HAVE A GOOD DAY I HAVE A GOOD
The most extreme part of this video is the amount of commercials they put in it
@who?  •30 years ago • lmao youre replying to a 7 month old comment? Find something else to reply to bruh
"@Hylic lmao your only response is ""boomer""? Find something else to say bruh"
Go premium..... cheapskate
@yes yes I do
My dear friend!  You talk too much! !
There is no place called the Southern Ocean. It would be the southern Indian Ocean the southern Atlantic Ocean the southern Etc.
Hurricane Ballbag?? Did I hear that right??
8:07 I live right on top of Matamoros which is south Texas
Hope your cool
News flash! Ice melts. Save your propaganda.
People working on Cargo ships are the most brave ones. Sea is the most beautiful yet terrifying experience. One must be ready to meet thier maker when boarding the ship.
@phyllis jorgensen what is the point of your comment Phyllis
@Alayni Marie …
K
"My uncle used to do it and he said it was really good money (he would give everyone in the family 200 dollars for Christmas, there were 8 of us) but he said it was so sketchy on the lakes (he worked on the great lakes, a lot of the time Lake Erie) and once he met who is now his wife he stopped doing it because it just wasn't worth it. It's definitely not a job to be messed with that's for sure."
Thank you for your amazing fantastic video I enjoying watching it
Wait wait wait dishing in storm isn’t somebody see a fin
"Did he say hurricane ""ball bag""?"
It's actually baw bag
yes and LOL
Yea
The ship in 16;36 is not the same ship as you were showing!
"Please go to the YouTube app, type in PETA, go to PLAYLISTS, find the Pandemic Playlist. Thanks"

"Don’t kid yourself, that’s Rob Schneider doing commentary. You can do it!"
Glacier tsunami jajaja that is a small wave 🤣
Hurricane bawbag 😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This is just my opinion but just seeing a horrifying storm outside (for example) or really strong winds is very scary and terrifying. I hope everyone is safe! ❤️
We live to tell the tale and head out for the next one.
"There's a storm here right now, and this made me really paranoid lol"
How do these make you feel? 😂 We film some of the largest waves ever caught on camera.  We work with 2 oil platforms that can accurately measure wave height so no guessing or exaggeration.  Enjoy 🌊🌊  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG-lkGl9kpwSEoYG5fJ3pwqVNZaDivv7z  And Meet the Crew   https://youtu.be/O8Kdw2b9cEQ
Omg
I hope you’re doing okay and that it has settled down wherever you are :)
Without talk is much better
What would I have done? I would have thrown up!
May god help all of. Us.
It Is NoT cAlLeD tArMaC it's called the runway idiot hey land on the runway then talk to the ramp where there gate is. You Bumbo
Didn't live up to the hype.
My father worked on offshore oil rigs and saw three of them turn upside down.
You’re father sounds like a very unlucky man to know.
Seriously?...Jesus!! What did the crew do then?! Working on oil rigs is so scary😱
"Most of these were ships at sea, you should rename it to Extreme Ocean Waves caught on Tape. There was very little actual weather events. Click bait. The thumbnail photo wasn’t even covered in the video."
The second event is literally a plane. Naming it ocean waves is just plain dumb.
Global warming is a myth. There’s more ice now than when Al Gore said the ice will all be melted by now. 😂😂
"@Emma Rose why exactly do I have to “pipe down”? I made a factual statement about the ice, and you try to insult me by calling me a genius and then you tell me to be quiet? So you’re saying because you don’t like reading factual information, then you need to insult and silence the person stating it? Or is it that anyone who dares to make a statement you don’t agree with needs to be insulted and silenced? Well, thank you for the compliment as I do have a very high IQ, but I will not be quiet just because you are too immature to stubbornly consider opinions opposed to your own."
imissnj2 ok Einstein. Pipe down
That looks like the Japan tsunami
"The ship was not a rescue ship, but a oil rig standby vessel called big wave master 1 she stays out in all’s sorts of weather. If you can’t get that right what else is wrong on here??? Thumbs down👎🏻"
"Yawn. Go the New Zealand Navy and ferry service. P.s. Charlie Sheen's a knob jockey . Giddy up tigers blood coursing through my veins🐅. He's another american genius like Donald eh. Not Ronald , the other clown in the white house."
Enjoy ur videos....Has anyone ever told u that u sound a lot like Charlie Sheen?
At 19:54 the camera goes to the left just at the Wrong time. I was thinking man this is way too cool then NOT :-) Peace

Hurricane Ballbag?
I like your voice
You talk too much
Where those whimpers I heard w/the last clip? Don't blame them at all!
I would keep going and safe life
Spoilt by a ridiculous amount of ads
Why
Your voice sounds like Charlie Sheen's.
Ms.gshunw hahaha I read this comment 30 seconds in. Spent the rest of the video expecting Charlie to start yelling about waves and tiger blood 😂😂cheers for ruining this for me
Stupid heading. Should be “boats that take on waves”
am used to this kind of event since i was a little kid my dad is an overseas capt. for me its not scary its fun..i dont know about others
I feel so scared in the ocean in a thunderstorm
ride on!
The waves out at sea even in a tropical storm are massive.
All's you can do is keep the bow pointed into the wind.
Could you imagine the satellite imagery?
I’m sorry but hurricane ball bag ? 😂😂
"I live in Devon, and spend a lot of time in Cornwall. Yes Imo was bad, but we get at least two storms far worse every year"
"Yep I live in Cornwall, and the footage showed of storm Imogen is just what the sea looks like on an average winters day!"
THIS IS ONE BORING VIDEO.
10:00 brought chills down my spine
Agreed
I literally felt seasick watching that poor trawler.
Is Charlie Sheen narrating this???
Hurricane bawbag hahaha
"Air travel ""convenient and comfortable""? Uh...no"
way to many commercials  you suck!
"Couldn't help but as I listen to this, the narrator  sounds like Charlie Sheen."
I was thinking the same thing! I thought maybe he just needed a job!
"0:47 He said Hurrican Bawbag, which the Scots named it. Bawbag is an scottish affectionate name for Scrotum! or a mild insult when referring to someone annoying (Ya Bawbag).  Loads of lol's 😂"
"Everyone loves the Scots, right? 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 I mean, name a cooler bunch of people?"
@John Henshaw in Scotland it’s bawbag
��🤣 I swear I must have hit rewind like 5 x before I had to check to see if ANYONE ELSE was going to say anthing about hurricane NUTSAC..
“Loads” 😭✋ stop
wedding in Tajikistan how to pass see
This was the most boring video I've ever watched. So disappointing.🙄
Is that CHARLIE SHEEN narrating this????
Did he say hurricane ballbag😂😂😂
I liked it
I swear this channel is narrated by Charlie Sheen!
"Only 7 adverts, no biggy...!"
Scary 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
A lot of adds on this video.
anyone knows what music has been used for background music in this video?
still can't find this tune or music under this title.
@Vlamadir Putin Thanks 🥰
"You think that's a glacier calving?  Maybe, but THIS is half a mountain coming down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3VTgIPoGU   Beautiful and horrifying. Lasts over an hour."
Video value is with a good narrator.
Met not M.E.T and there is no r in Luton
Worst channel
"Way too many ads, there's no way I would subscribe, you guys completely suck!"
Hello i fear God and we must remember that mother nature Carry great power hello
"Here in s.e.Alaska, we sometimes have 85 mile an hour wind gusts called Taku winds.  A 125 pound woman told me she was actually picked up off her feet by wind"
I would imagine that you get winds a bit stronger than that?  We work in the North Sea and seen winds up to 120 knots.
"Don't be putting a value on women, anyway £105 is way too cheap to pay for her."
I believe that cuz I'm a 105 pound woman an that has happened to me
"Number 15.. I heard ""hurricane ballbag"" 🤣"
"What can we say live love Luton, and that’s why we don’t fly from there"
"That was crazy, it was almost like it was raining inside the terminal! God only knows just how strong that storm must have been to have that effect."
"or ""Lutron Airport"", as he called it."
willNE gang
Did he say hurricane Ballbag?
There's way too much talking and explaining in between the clips. Just show us the clips with a few seconds of explanation please.
"what would you do, if you were confronted with a dangerously boring video? this video will challenge you for 19:54 minutes."
Wow that was amazing
"Most Extreme, ..... this is most?!?  Oh, ...please!"
"Most ads, in the most anoying parts!"
"Roberto exactly, this was far from the most extreme.  It was mostly ships on rough seas. Click bait."
Roberto proper grammar? I was referring to your punctuation. Go back to school please.
Chill with the punctuation
"Sure sounds like him, weird!!"
This is the guy from weird history 100%
Great respect for sailors
Thank you very much 😊
"I was stuck in a fishing boat off the coast of North Queensland many years ago and we were in the middle of a Force nine storm  and the only thing I am happy about that did not cause me to have nightmares was the fact that I was helmsman that 'night' and it was too dark to see what we were sailing through, how rough was it ... the compass needle was swinging 20 degrees either way from the course I had set the boat for ....ah to be that young again !!   :-)  :-)  :-)"
Amazing!
Hi mom
"My husband was a commercial crab fisherman in the Bering Sea. He didn’t tell me much of what happened up there until he never went fishing again. Good thing cuz if I’d known that stuff, not saying I didn’t realize he was in danger, I would not have let him go again. I spent years of sleepless nights"
Joe were you under a bare pole and had a sea anchor out?  Or did you just have a peanut  sail out
Those are some sobering videos.  Nature is the one in control.  We're just insects scurrying about our short-lived little lives.
Mother Nature
I’d just pray to God to Keep us safe
"Due to natural process and including  global warming dude, global warming is a natural process."
Amber from Baltic sea !!! ;-)
"Viewing (at least) number 15 (the 1st video) is REALLY hard as it's in 2D. I'm sure it was REALLY scary but, as a viewer, they just look like waves lol. There's no size or motion comparison"
"It's not 2D.  It's shot from the wheelhouse or above the wheelhouse down to the focsle.  To give you an idea, the deck of the focsle is about 20'-25' above the water and the waves are about that or higher.  I honestly don't mean this as a dig but I think you may need corrective lenses if you are unable to differentiate space in that clip."
Go straight to the Comments Section and see what The Experts have to say about this video.

This video sucked. Waves and icebergs are not what people wanna see about weather.  Many better things to show. I could do better easily and so could 99% of all people. Step it up.
im notg so far from lutonn

Storm Ophelia we had no electricity for 8 days...hurricane Charlie too
Does anyone noticed the flying object in the map at the top left corner at 06:36 .is it the space station or the other satellite orbiting earth

"15 most MUNDANE Weather Events Caught on Video.    but then, that wouldn't bait the clickers now, would it? Shameless!"
"@Bejamin Lopez Well, I did that too but felt the need to vent my spleen with this one. Waste of time, I know, but still..."
"Well, you know, a lot of people have never experienced anything like these.  They do illustrate something, though:  as tough and advanced as we think we are, Nature shrugs and millions of people are nothing but a memory.  We are resilient but we are a moment's existence to the world we live on.  I hope some people can look at these and see that.  There's nothing mundane about storms at sea.  All it takes is a rogue wave..."
All those Captains of those ships 🚢 are Aces!!!
This is not that bad
I walk the shore of the England’s North Sea in the mid 70’s.  It was blowing so hard you had to yell to be heard. Love it

"It was storming massively here in the Netherlands when i was 8 ish. Mom told me not to jump ... I jumped, of course. I landed up 4 meters further and almost in the sea 🤣"

Well that was boring
#15 - I’d have been sick ! 🤣😂🤣 #10 - It isn’t the M.E.T. Office as the narrator states - it’s the Met. Office - Met is the abbreviation for Meteorological. #8 - It’s not LUTRON ! It’s Luton !
Hurricane ballbag in the North Sea?!?! 🤣🤣🤣
Fiona Murray I went looking for this comment and was not disappointed. 🤣
It's actually Bawbag lol got to get the Scottish accent right
Call sos
Air travel and comfort.   What airlines you flying.
Wots with the end of this video sounds like some one having a fit in the background
Probably your English teacher
"How the hell does a poorly built structure that leaks (UK airport) = 'extreme weather event'?  Also, 'Storm hits Cornwall and cause $1 million in damages!'  Seriously?  You were really grasping at straws with this list!"
"And I think that was the “weather bomb” of storm Dennis or Claria that hit so it was really strong,the severity also has to do with area affected which was huge,"
"Oh your talking about the airport? Ahh because the thunderstorms were severe,not the building leaking it self. If you re hear what he says he explian the storm got so strong it leaked through the airport as parts of the feeling collapsed ,even if it was poorly built I think it would take more then a little Potter patter for that to happen especially to that degree"
This video pretty much sucked
Knowing that water travels to the lowest point downhill all of the water from Alaska in the northern part of this silly ball would go to Antarctica.Trump 2020

Very lame....you guys are almost as bad as the fake news ruining our country.

Thumbs down! Too many commercials! What a put off!
Nice video and very informative and very entertaining and very satisfaction.
Y does the guy that does the talking sound like the person that talk in simple history videos
I swear Charlie Sheen is doing the narration in this video.
@ZombieCabDriver It's him.
Winning
"I was thinking same thing ,could it be him ?"
Way too many details prior to footage
I swear he's not
Just pray that god loves you and will give you a second chance
And then remember he doesn't exist and get on with it
Both trilling and scary
too many ads!!!!

Calving glaciers aren't weather related
I don’t know if you meant to say Caving... but YES THEY ARE WEATHER RELATED
Boooooring
I'm so sorry to say in my opinion this was this was quit boring. not at all what I expected from your channel... Your videos are normally much better. There was only a couple that really showed a wee bit of bad weather.
The chap mentioning Hurrican Bawbag was the high point.
"its Met Office short for ""The Meteorological Office"""
"No. its like ""I met an office!"""
Charlie Sheen?
No sir. 😁
I gave up watching this. For some reason the vast majority of this video is oceanic....with the wide variety of extreme weather events on our planet why stick so much with 1 or 2 types?
looked more like the bottom 5% of extreme weather that happens on earth... 8:43 'an estimated million dollars in damage'???? what a joke.
Disastrous situations...
What would you do if you were in this situation? Me:well I would pretend I was a pirate and that it happens all the time  Edit: don't take this seriously
Jack sparrow angry
@Greg Akinson I like pirates !😡
lol cute
U are good boi
Nature is just amazing she always prevails from the damage we create
I walk the shore of the England’s North Sea in the mid 70’s.  It was blowing so hard you had to yell to be heard. Love it
Sounds so weird someone who isn't Scottish saying bawbag 😂😂😂
What’s a bawbag?
Was SOOO gonna make a post asking if that's what he said pmsl
Totally agree wae ye bud 👍
Way to many commercials.

"Baltic Sea is just one of hundreds if other seas. Nothing special was on Regina Seaways that day. Truck drivers were drunk (as usual), and nobody got hurt."
Just my luck. Finally go on vacation and here comes a tidal wave or plane crash. Ugh. What next. Lol
"@TheRecalcitrant1  Thank you for your kind comment!  I personally hate politics because of just this kind of situation, where we have a national and global crisis and a bunch of (politicians) people who might profit from it in some way are determined to do so, I don't trust ANY person in office, so I'm taking no sides.  I  happened to have a conversation with my mother about 40 years ago (she was born in 1925), and many of her school friends were missing parents and siblings from the 1918 flu.  She told me that I would see a pandemic in my lifetime, that HER grandmother had told her that, and every hundred years or so, a disease would decimate humanity to keep a balance. I looked up some historical accounts and there have been very weird pandemics in Europe as well as the Americas...England in the 1500 and 1500s had the ""sweating sickness"" about which almost nothing is known, except that many people would suddenly get it and die in days.  It vanished, and no one knows what it was...the bubonic plague is the big one in the 1300s, but there have been many...no one seems to know where syphilis originated, exactly, but it wiped out millions as well... the simple answer is something is always going to happen, and we just get it or not, survive or not, and do the best we can for each other."
"@christine paris I apologize- I am certain what you had/have was or is very real- but what they have made this entire ordeal into is very sad.  We will never know what the real truth is, unfortunately. Oddly enough, I live in Soth Florida(and have for almost 50 yrs., and I know NOT A SOUL that had or has 'covid  19' for sure. Good luck and I truly hope you and your family and friends fully rebound from your illnesses"
"@TheRecalcitrant1  Covid isn't real?  I had it and whatever you want to call it, an illness like that is no joke.  If you want to pretend it doesn't exist, it's up to you.  I hadn't been sick for 20 years, and this was way different than anything I ever had.  Plus, my husband and friends had it... For not being ""real"", it sure costs us a lot of time and we still have symptoms that have lingered for months."
@christine paris But that isn't even real!!

@Sivagami Kamaresan l can tell you why if you open your mind. Otherwise stop reading. A ateist know things due to science and God or Allah where also scientist and less educated people followed them like dogs to their owner. You got to stop doing that or at least be a cat.

"so, which one of these was climate change? Don't you think you want to get that out of the title?"
@Mats Bengtsson Correct Mats
How about poor construction rather than climate change
God gave us all the phropetic signs that he will send JESUS CHRIST anytime from NOW.      THIS WAS NOT A CLIMATE CHANGE. GOD shows He's extreme power  to remind all the people all over the world THAT SECOND COMING OF JESUS CHRIST AND JUDGEMENT DAY will come  and execute anytime from now.       PRAY.
Oroville didn't collapse
70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water. Don't piss it off.

They are happy...
"Die Aussage über den Klimawandel durch menschliche Aktivitäten ist der pure Unsinn !! Klimawandel gab es in der Erdgeschichte schon immer . Menschen spielen da gar keine Rolle obwohl einige (Habeck, Bearbock) sich das einbilden."
clickbait
Hire the Dutch for these problems.
"Isa_28:2  Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand."
 
" Isa_29:6  Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire."
Not climate change noob.
The observation is *only build a community miles away from the dam wall* not that planners would be foolish enough to do anyway
"The climate changes regardless of what humans do , it did before we were here and has been much worse and it will when we are gone. stop making out it only happened in the last 200 years."
Man made global warming is fake news >>>
JEEZZ!!!
Alda was hat'n Baufehler mit Klimawandel zu tun? :D
"oh look, a commie propaganda channel..."
2:19 😳
That definition of climate change at the top is so stupid. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Man has NOTHING to do with it.
"Cool compilation of dam failures, most of which were unrelated to climate change."
"Accidents on dams used to be called avoidable construction errors caused by people.  Today it's all being blamed on climate change because it's convenient and gives those responsible an excuse.  In the meantime, climate change is even being blamed for earthquakes and tsunamis, as has already been reported in the press."
"Water, streams, rivers, etc are meant to flow. Not be held up."
"Not one of these was a “natural disaster”. This was a bunch of videos of man made structures failing. None of any of this is caused by climate change.   BTW, 77k subscribers. Nobody gives a shit about “climate change”…"
and again they cannot turn the foken phone 90 degrees.
Climate change  😂😂😂 Of course.
"I don't believe in climate change , unless you call all the glacier cover of North America disappearing 15,000 yrs ago a change . I believe Desertification is your problem now , or haven't you noticed ?"

" Call it sabotage call it whatever. Covid wasn't something they just happen to discover and spent millions of dollars on to reproduce just incase it was good for man kind. Covid was intentional, a Bio weapon. Its funny that when its hot its Climate change and some activists are to blame for the fires, yet when it rains suddenly dams burst and there's too much water.."

La terre ronde ??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Love it, Mother Earth retakes her rights on the ""civilization"" .  Soon she'll delete us easily as a wave deletes a footprint on sand."
What do those accidents have to do with supposed climate change?
"terimakasih , sangat bermanfaat"
Climate change is a big hoax. Period
"In the 5th sector of Bucharest, we have an agricultural register since entering the EU with overlapping areas in the ANCPI cadastral plan to be more farms. They are fictitious farms with fictitious production and European funds, full of rubbish. So called farmers burn cables to get the copper from them all day long. In the Government building is the ANCPI office of Cristea Marcela, she belongs to the group of ex-president Ion Iliescu."
"This is a far left channel, get ready for bull carp."
"Nature always wins, bitches."
"These are not natural disasters, they are man-made structures which cannot withstand the forces of nature."
Imagine taking a fat nap while people are evacuating
Climate change propaganda! That dam failed because politicians neglected needed repairs for decades. Stop lying!
Le climat n'a rien à voir la dedans !
Damn.
DAMN!!!
"This is NOT because off Climate Change.You drag that into your description so you think that attracts more people to read this and watch this.This all happened because off bad construstion or bad design,nothing more.There is no Climate Change!!!"
"Never let the facts get in the way of an agenda..... first we were going to run out of oil, then iron ore, then the ice caps were going to melt, then the ozone layer was going to kill us all, then acid rain was going to kill all the crops, then oceans were going to rise and then space junk was going to rain down us and now global warming, er I mean climate change. If you do your research and look back to the late 60's you can see the ""panic pattern"" develop and instigated.... just saying......"
BRUH natural ? rly ? you think that Dam was Natural ? yre you sure it isnt bio ?
climate BS
It's so easy to sit back and accuse climate change caused by fossil fuel use. I think most of these occurrences weren't directly related to climate change! Got to blame it on something though don't ya!
"Natural climate change is a closed loop system, that’s right, self correcting.  Actual history and evidence… wow what a concept."
"We are too used to “normal”- humanity didn’t have the normalcy we have now until the latest 50ish years, so welcome to the real normalcy."
Sorry to burst your bubble but this isnt climate change its called lazy engineering and not doing proper inspections
the guy from 2:19 wantet to get this movie like explosion video
"For a billion of years, these waters flowed unrestrained.   Then we come around and think ourselves masters of the world?   World has time, we do not.   The moment we realize we merely live upon it and the world itself is the master, can we truly find a peace with the world"
C’est dammage
It's a tsunami on time bomb.
"The worst is watching people stand around looking at what’s happening, I’m sure for some people there was nowhere to go, they were doomed..it’s so sad …"
"No, Its nice to see how the Nature get all back."
This is NOT climate change. Propaganda
"I'm not sure that dam failures are considered a ""natural"" disaster"
Skip to  7:48 for the best part
climate change the biggest con job ever
Trying to understand why this goofy and annoying so-called music is being played…
Climate change is a hoax believed only by idiots!  Every video on here is from man made construction.  Including dams made in Brazil.  The BS is thick folks!
Nothing to do with climate change.
"Planet Earth has gone through many changes since it was created. NOTHING to do with climate change. What is happening is a natural occurence, Earthquakes, volcanoes erupting etc, and man cannot do anything to stop them. This planet has gone through many changes and will continue."
What has this got to do with climate change? I see dams that failed due to poor construction and engineering. The reason we have climate denial and inaction is because of nonsense like this.
Engineering failures not climate change!
Your explanation of climate change is false. Climate change takes place over thousands of years. Your propaganda is unscientific.
"No, not climate change. it’s the lord GOD!"
"This has nothing to do with climate change.  Man has very little to do with it. Increases and decreases in the global temperature occur naturally over millions of years due to a variety of factors, For example the position of the earth in relation to the sun,  meteors hitting the earth, and solar flares.  To think that we have something to do with it is quite grandiose and misleading. The elitists want us to subscribe to this dogma so they tax The hell out of us through a carbon tax. Stop believing the lies."
This is why everybody should drive a Tesla.
"They are man made disasters, nine out of ten cases.           🇬🇧🇺🇦"
None of these are even about climate. You have to be sheep to believe that these dam failures are about climate. FU

Climate change my ass…
Thats not a climate change the people in this Video are stupid to Build something.
Yeah this has little to do with climate change and is more so a product of negligent engineering.

"Yeah.. its all climate change (!) The mountains, valleys... the grand canyon... all got shaped because the dinosaurs were driving such huge cars(!)"
A few Ooop's moment's in there
Construction  Disaster is a new reason causes nature disaster...and climate change will come after....the results were damageable..🆘
Massive Photoshop failure.
"Here is a fine example of Man trying to control MOther Nature, It is NOT a Natural Disaster, it is the result of GREEDY Manipulaters called HUMANS we will never learn"
what a load of shit. climate change had nothing to do with any of these events. stop your lies and mis-reporting.
Fake videos. Other circumstances caused these dams to breach.  Nice try!
Burning of fossil fuels has nothing to do with the the weather patterns. The weather patterns change every couple of hundred years. Only politicians believe in global warming.
You are so full of crap!

"Climate change, regardless of whether you believe in it or not, does not cause DAMS to fail. People cause dams to fail, bad engineering cause dams to fail, flaws in the design is what will cause a dam to fail. The best chance climate change would have to cause a dam to fail does not exist! Because things that don't exist do not cause DAMS to fail."
"This is SO irresponsible!! Yes, many of these disasters have roots in climate change but you threw in examples of structures that malfunctioned due to errors in construction!  If you can’t report accurately, then don’t report!"

"I don't know what the fuck you are playing at with this video, the video only had dam failures in it, nothing to do with climate change. As for climate change, the climate has been constantly changing for billions of years, climate change isn't man made, it never has been man made and it never will be man made."
Awesome video... thanks for sharing.

The wages of sin is death.  Truly repent of your sins and be saved eternally.
"We are from Bicol Region in the Philippines and we always experience strong typhoons. There was one typhoon (Reming) that lasted for several hours. Our town was submerged in water. One brgy. was wiped out and about a thousand were killed in that area including someone we personally know. So we really have to do something for our mother nature like tree planting (mangrove, bamboo etc) , cleaning the canals and coastal clean-up."
"This video was about dam failures, nothing to do with natural disasters."
"Oroville dam never had a ""massive dam failure"", but problems because the exceptional spillway wasn't achieved and then the ""normal spillway"" had to support an overflow and broke in its lower part."
"How is a dam failure characterized as a 'natural disaster'? A beaver dam, maybe, but that's about it."
These are man made disasters.  Not natural
That's money doooood
Be afraid of nature.
fake picture as always
damm it...
no climat change >Human and HAARP >change the climat> is real !!
"These videos are nothing to do with climate change, some are human error and some are what nature has been doing for millions of years. Try posting some real evidence instead of using old videos to hype your money guzzling schemes."
Fake
"Yeah, a man made structure failing is due to climate change, the failed economy is due to climate change, lets see, slavery was due to climate change, illegal immigration problems are due to climate change, I can't pay my bills--climate change, my girlfriend cheated on me---yep, climate change, can't sustain an an erection---climate change.  Global warming idiots, give it a rest already!"
Notice 95% of these terrible supposed?  disaster s are caused by messing with nature its not nature fault but mankind s inadequate brain power…
How do you plan on “fighting” climate change?  By shaking your fists angrily at the sun?? 😂👍🏻 no holes in that plan…
"Hasn’t climate ALWAYS been changing? Did it just start in the last 100 years out of what,4.5 billion years? If you believe this, raise your right hand. Then smack the hell outta yourselves, you’re all fools."
Scenes from 6:02 till 6:26 are not dam damages. These were results of rain in different mountain regions of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
fake ass news
Hoover dam looked like it was gonna pop
this is no climate change from co2...this is geo. eng. weather manipulation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye
Oroville was the emergency spillway being destroyed not the actual dam itself

You are a fool!  The whole world knows we've had weather modification & earthquake tech since '46.  And it was the HAARP array that caused the hole in the ozone layer.  Do get a clue and stop drinking the Climate Cult Kool-Aid!
what you know about earthquake in that area n this time?
This in not climate change this is poor planning and poor follow through.

"Sorry, people lie about climate change to support the data they want us t believe.  One day, we will all find that “climate change “ has been a terrible hoax to promote one world government. Lies."
"Certainly Jesus, son of Mary (the servant and messenger of Allah ), peace be upon both of them, will descend in Syria - Al-Manara, on two angel wings, wearing two dresses of cotton, his face dripping with water as if he was coming out of a shower, his breath reaching the tip of his fingers at the length of his arm, killing everyone who entered his breath except  Muslims, he breaks the cross, kills the pig and accepts only the religion of Islam, he prays with the Muslims in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, then he will kills the Antichrist, then he and those with him hide on Mount Al-Tur for fear of Gog and Magog, then he prays to Allah to kill them, so they all die because of a flying worm that enters  in their noses, then he would rule the earth for 40 years in which love, justice and much prosperity would prevail even children play with snaks and wolves guard the cattle , then he would die and be buried in Muslim cemeteries.   [4:171]  O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not ""Three"" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender.   [4:172]  The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him;   [4:173]  Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper.   [4:174]  O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light;   [4:175]  As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road.  19:81]  And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for them.   [19:82]  Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.   [19:83]  Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion ?   [19:84]  So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days).   [19:85]  On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company.   [19:86]  And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd,   [19:87]  They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord.   [19:88]  And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son.   [19:89]  Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing   [19:90]  Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins,   [19:91]  That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son,   [19:92]  When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son.   [19:93]  There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave.   [19:94]  Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering.   [19:95]  And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.   [19:96]  Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love.   [19:97]  And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk.   [19:98]  And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ?   39:4]  If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.   [39:5]  He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the Mighty, the Forgiver ?   [39:6]  He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away ?   [39:7]  If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another’s load. Then unto your Lord is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). ——-----------------------------------—----------  .How many children would you like to have?

"Not caused mainly by man using fossil fuels. There's no valid science to prove that. This stuff has been going on since the beginning of time. Man changing the landscape by building and living in at risk areas has a lot to do with it. You build on slopes, mountains, the beach, next to large rivers, etc and you have a high risk of something bad happening to you when nature does what it does. Climate change is natural. The earth has been warmer than it is now and colder. It's just the way of things. So don't use your agenda to infer anything different. There are many scientist and research debunking all this man made climate change. Notice you don't say global warming any longer. It's climate change. There is a reason for that."
When you try to tame nature be prepared for a bite on the arse.
I assume that climate change was also responsible for the release of all the toxic waste as well? Thinking that was the company's lack of maintenance...because they're cheap and negligent. As with many of the scenes throughout this video.

"Climate change bullshit. Take a look at the skies above you and see with your own eyes the relentless cross-hatching of chemical trails laced with metallic nano particles, for at least the last three decades.  They are not pretty little vapour trails, nor are they placed there for your good."

"Stupid melodramatic titles like this, from blind and gullible people, are why we're paying ridiculously massive 'green taxes' in a bid to achieve a mythical, unreachable 'net zero'.  The problem humanity is placing on the climate/environment is overpopulation causing mass deforestation, pure and simple. But in this woke, 'must not offend anyone' world, nobody will talk about it because it would involve fingers being pointed!.  Who's been responsible for the continued 'climate change' over the last 300 million years, when there was only one continent (pangaea), through the triassic, jurrasic and cretaceous periods, when the average surface temperature was over 50°C. We're those pesky dinosaurs burning fossil fuels like demented idiots? Or how about the last ice age 27,000 years ago that, in geological terms, we've only just come out. Those wooly mammoths were incredibly reckless farting every two seconds, letting all that methane gas out.  Of course the temperatures will rise, it's called evolution!"

Nothing to do with climate change.
Climate change does NOT cause da breaks. Physical failure breaks dams. Did you ever get educated ?
Oops!
Nature is taking a revenge on humankind.😜😜😜

As usual...these disasters have nothing to do with climate change.... this is why nobody takes you Globalist Climate Activists seriously

Just wanted to be comment 667
"Man hasn't been burning fossil fuels long enough to truly measure 'LONG TERM SHIEFTS IN TEMPERATURES AND WEATHER PATTERNS"" CLIMATOLOGY refers to the study of very long term shifts in temp and weather patterns over a very long period of time....not meteorologist which can predict whether anomalies week or days out."
@Richard Cowley Cannot disagree with you on both points
STOP LYING
"Most damn failures are not related to 'climate change' (description of ""climate change"" above is also incorrect..FYI) but moreover related to improper engineering as to where fault lines in the earth are. A lot of damns are built on fault lines and engineers take into consideration these lines   when building Damns, high-rise building, etc.  But when they believe that the fault line is old and non-active they build on top of these faults, when backfilling subject Damn, guess what? Too much weight on that fault line and down comes the Damn. Climate Change, which, yes is happening, is a phenomena of the planet itself and the way the planet fixes this Phenomena is though an ICE AGE. Scientist have proven this with ICE CORES. Activist of government sponsored ""Climate Change"" would have you believe that man is totally at fault,  P.S man wasn't burning fossel fuels back before the ice age, and the little Ice age....It was true climate change as what is happening currently."
So climate change was responsible for the man made disasters? Did the workers have heat stroke or something? Asking for a friend of course.

Climate change is bullshit the left made up.

"Start believing God. Otherwise earth is ready to shrink / sink us down. People now a days are too happy in living their “Own Style” that God didn’t approve. So now God’s FURY is out raging the war to sink us down. Live how God wants us to not “Left Wing Politicians”.   Bottom line is start believing in God. I can see China literally washing out. They do not live anything alone. They eat that moves under and above earth, swims in water and flies in sky. So now they are paying the price to imbalance the planet for all insects rodents and animals.   In USA “Left Wing” pushing their agenda to enjoy alternate life styles. They have no rights to push their “STLY” on kids in high school.   Disney World paid the dear price of pushing their “Leftist” “LIFESTYLE” agenda on kids as little as 3 years old. Disney is at the bottom of their totem pole."
Not climate change. Natural earth affects.
Mother nature cleaning up
"Everything nowadays is blamed on climate change. Yes due to overpopulation. We have to reduce humans cause all humans are consumers and what we consume costs energy and pollution. Clothing housing food water all need energy and cause solutions. That is the problem women just keep popping out kids like the production line. By the time we wake up, it's too late cause all forests animals clean water and the world's oceans will be polluted and no more resources and clean air so the earth as we know it dies. Life will go one but with a totally different species and none would be intelligent but very adoptive to strong weather changes. I thought the Nukes will kill us. No. I mean just look in the states they make abortion illegal. Millions of sick incest and unwanted kids will be born and become murderers and thieves cause didn't get love as a kid cause he was unwanted due to his/her immature parents or just 1 one night stand or just an accident. Makes me sick even thinking about it and all those idiots who support the ban on abortion. Just think how many boys and guys who don't want kids the government will force them to pay child support and alimony so they will quit work under the table and draw welfare. That is what does and creates corruption. This is what causes the pollution and the climate change by recklessly having so many kids. Just thinking back like 27 years and If we didn't have the abortion we would have a retarded kid who is a burden on us and my 2 other kids who are healthy and a burden on society cause when I die who is going to take care and those retards just a pure consumer and society has no use for them and they are just a burden to all. Nature rules what humans ignore. In nature, only the young strong and healthy survive old sick and weak die and we wouldn't have to accept rejects like those abcdqrstxyz people. I mean what the f...? When you are born look at what is in between your legs that is what you are that is how you were born. If not then you are sick and a reject and shouldn't be among us like the retards. Stop the making more humans and that is the key to reducing global warming and pollution."
"So Dams failing is due to ""climate change""?  Gtfoh"
This is not due to climate change.

vary little to do with climate change and all due to piss poor engineering and greed
Climate change has been happing on this plant for at least 4 billion years. Anthropogenic climate change is a scam created by politicians who wish to bilk more money from taxpayers.
gad dam
"Man made disasters! Design errors, rush to build. Poor Planet!"
All man made dams should be destroyed. Allow nature to do what it needs to do. Enough with the CONTROL!!!!
None of this is due to climate change.....these are man made failures.  Bad engineering.

How does climate change cause Dam failure......🙄
Mother nature has had enough of us human beings altering and polluting she's taking care of business the way she sees fit get right with God repent start respecting her and our God 👍💪🙏🕊️🙏
Sadly these are not natural.  These are all man made or created.
"I thought the failure of a dam is a ""Construction Failure"" and NOT a natural disaster. If a dam cannot hold back the water it was designed to hold back it is a ""Man Made Disaster"". Poor Mother Nature gets blamed for enough stuff.........Dont blame ""Climate Change"" either. A dam is a dam no matter what the climate is."

That 1st dam failure had NOTHING to do with climate change. It had everything to do with how reckless man has become when digging out massive underground holes and how they get rid of waste byproducts from the mine!! CLIMATE CHANGE MY AZZ!!
wow.
"A dam break is not a natural disaster. Natural disasters are hurricanes, tsunamis etc."
"Climate change, so sick of hearing that stupidity!!!"
bullsh-t
This had nothing tot do with climate change. Inform your watchers in a proper wat.
Why is anyone surprised. Man will always fu with their arrogance that they have control of nature  Fools!

Only god can hold back water 🙏👍 But people think there smarter then God!!! Lol!!
This entire production is nothing more than a Fraudulent propaganda.
Don't play with nature if he plays with you then don't say anything 😂😂
Climate change   NO  ITS JUST THE WEATHER  & building dams in High risk areas prone to earthquakes avalanches and crappy Chinese building practises
"No correlation between the burning of fossil fuels and these dam breaks,  What a colossal fraud.  ""NATURAL DISASTERS Massive Dam Failures CAUGHT ON CAMERA Liberal Democratic Policies"""
"Climate change has been happening since before man kind and will continue long after, it’s happening every minute of every day and isn’t human caused or a bad thing, it’s a nature thing that no one will ever control and is a tactic to enrich people that don’t work in jobs that produce anything but fear"
Climate change is a lie of the devil and his people the Democrats. They tried to use global warming as a means of taking over the world. But everybody found out that that was all just a lie a hoax. Now they call it climate change. But Jesus/God is not gonna let the devil and the Democrats take over this country America. God is already promised that he’s going to punish all the Democrats and some treasonous Republicans who stole the election from President Trump. He’s gonna bring all these people down and what they’ve done to this country primarily the Democrats the last two years. And he’s gonna punish Them severely. And put the rightful president President Trump back in power. Climate change is just another lie like global warming.
Less than 1% of 'Climate Change' is human-caused.
"Marc 13:8 Une nation s’élèvera contre une nation, et un royaume contre un royaume ; il y aura des tremblements de terre en divers lieux, il y aura des famines. Ce ne sera que le commencement des douleurs."

People who build their house on the banks of a river must not have heard of Murphy's Law. Now on to better things.  WTF is climate change anyway? I know it storms on Earth like it to form Earth's distant past so it must be another climate...... say the climate needed to bring on lawlessness or a majority rule democracy??? A climate change like the FBI investigating the ones who are getting fingers pointed at them while the problem is the one pointing the finger who never get investigated.   The COUNTY Commissioner here ran for election on a promise to pave the streets of the town. He won and did pave the streets. Some years later with no maintenance....... bypass Keyes they grow Texas sized potholes here. You climate change idiots better start opening your eyes to the realization that stupid people do stupid things and can only blame themselves.

"As yes, those pesky humans and their things."
"𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗨𝗽 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 The United Nations recently celebrated the International Mother Earth Day as a reminder to protect the environment. Heat waves, droughts, fires and heavy rains that cause severe flooding have become more frequent in many parts of the world due to climate change, which affects the entire worldwide population. The Earth is facing a “triple planetary crisis,” warn UN officials. Climate disruption, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste are the main areas of concern regarding the current state of the environment. This year, the Earth Day’s theme is “Invest In Our Planet,” so what would humanity's best investment for the planet be? We need to start by cleaning up the planet. There is no place on Earth where the air and water are clean, and that's a real problem. In theory, tackling this issue should be our priority when it comes to taking action to improve the dismal state of our planet. But let’s not fool ourselves. Such a plan alone will solve nothing. It will only help the international organizations to justify their own existence. They tick off ""done"" to raise as much money as they want, and that's it. If we do not improve relations between us, we will not be able to achieve the great and ambitious improvement in nature that we want and need to attain globally. We will never achieve a good result through bureaucratic, mechanical measures. There are a lot of people sitting in their comfortable offices profiting from the environmental crisis and demanding money and respect. They keep flying from one end of the world to the other on all kinds of missions to make a lot of noise with what they are ""doing"" and which everyone ""needs to hear"" as if that alone means something is happening, but in practice we see no real progress. The Earth must also be cleansed of them, of these people who engage in useless campaigns that only cause harm because they mislead the world, leading it away from the real solution. The cleaning of the planet should start inside out. If we do not clean the planet from within, and continue with our reckless behavior and the selfish nature of our hearts as before, nothing will change for the better. The immense sums invested in environmental initiatives should be directed to spreading an educational process aimed at improving the way we relate to each other. Humans are the most developed and influential factors of all of nature's levels: still, vegetative, animate and human. Since we occupy the highest level in nature, positively affecting the environment, the climate, and nature in general can be achieved by reaching positive relations among us. On the contrary, by letting our divisive drives tear apart human relations, we also destroy our surrounding environment, the very nature that our lives depend on. The more we humans are able to correct ourselves by changing our divisive attitudes toward each other into positive attitudes of mutual support, encouragement, mutual responsibility, and reciprocal concern, the more we will receive positive feedback from nature. And the more we develop without making this necessary correction, the more negative feedback we will receive from nature, as we have experienced in the form of natural disasters, pandemics. It is of utmost importance for us to organize our thoughts, desires and qualities so that we understand that saving the environment and a shift to a better future depend solely on changing our attitudes to each other: from antagonistic egoism to positive, compassionate and cooperative relationships."
Only God is a super power ❤️
�� we humans think we are so smart
These seem to have absolutely nothing to do with climate change. Just really bad engineering. Climate change my arse.
"Arrogant ignorance to think burning fossil fuel caused any of this. Most of this was engineering failure, the rest is proof that we are of ZERO consequence to this planet and we cannot stop anything when mother nature takes over. 2004 Indonesia, Krakatoa, Tonga, Japan. Or any other natural disaster. This planet can kill more in one swipe than we can. This planet can generate more of your so called greenhouse gasses in a single volcanic event than we have in the history of human industry. But this does not fit your agenda does it.... Oh dear lord CO2. Yet the planet will generate 10,000 times as much through natural cycles in a single day than we can. Sulphur dioxide from diesel engines is ruining everything, yet Kilauea will produce more in a day than we will in a year. Everyday. Every damn time I throw the fact that all but Methane are heavier than air into the argument I get the diffusion claim. Sure, next door, on Venus. It takes 100 times earths atmospheric pressure and about 800 degrees. Then there is the claim that the earths oceans are getting hotter but everyone forgets BTU's. Yeah that's what it would take. We would have a lot more to worry about then a 1 degree temperature rise. We simply are not that close to the sun."

"Belief in God:  Muslims believe in one God, who is unique and incomparable, who has no sons or partners, and they believe that no one or anything has the right to be worshiped except Him, and Him alone. He is the true God, and all other gods are false. He has the most magnificent names and His attributes are sublime and perfect. No one shares His divinity or His attributes. In the Quran, God describes Himself in these terms: Say: ""He is God, Unique. God, The only one to be implored for what we desire. He never begat, nor was he begotten. And no one is equal to Him."". (Quran, 112:1-4) Chapter 112 of the Quran, written in Arabic calligraphy. No one has the right to be invoked, implored, prayed to, or to be the object of any act of worship except God. Only God is the Almighty, Creator, Ruler, and Lord of everything in the entire universe. He directs all affairs. He does not need any of His creatures, but all His creatures depend on Him for everything they need. He is the One who hears everything, who sees everything, and who knows everything. In a perfect way, His knowledge embraces everything, what is manifest and what is secret, what is public and what is private. He knows the things of the past, the things that will happen, and how they will happen. Nothing happens in this world except by His will. Everything He decides happens, and everything He refuses does not happen and never will. His will is above that of all creatures. He has power over everything, and He is able to do everything. He is the Most Merciful, the Most , it is said that God is more merciful to His creatures than a mother is to her child.1 God is very far from injustice and tyranny. He is All-Wise in all His actions and decrees. If someone wants to ask God for something, he or she can ask Him directly, without having to ask anyone to intercede with Him on their behalf.   God is not Jesus, and Jesus is not God.2 Jesus himself rejected this idea. God said in the Quran: They are certainly disbelievers who say: ""In truth, God is the Messiah, son of Mary."" While the Messiah said: ""O children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord"". Whoever associates with God other deities, God forbids him Paradise; and his refuge will be the Fire. And for the unjust,3 no helpers! (Quran, 5:72) God is not a trinity. He said in the Quran: Surely they are disbelievers who say, ""Verily God is the third of three."" While there is no divinity but God. And if they keep saying it, surely a painful retribution will come upon the disbelievers among them. Won't they then repent to God and ask for His forgiveness? For God is Forgiving and Merciful. The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger... (Quran, 5:73-75) Islam rejects ideas that God rested on the seventh day of creation, wrestled with one of His angels, was an envious conspirator against mankind, or was embodied in any human being whatsoever. Islam also rejects attributing any human form to God. All of these ideas are considered blasphemous. God is the Most High. He is far from any imperfection. He is never tired. He never gets sleepy and He doesn't sleep. The Arabic word Allah means ""God"" (the one and only true God who created the entire universe). This word, Allah, is a name for God that is used by Arabic speakers, whether they are Muslim Arabs or Christian Arabs. This word cannot be used to refer to anyone or anything other than the one true God. The Arabic word Allah is mentioned more than 2150 times in the Quran. In Aramaic, a language that is closely related to Arabic and which Jesus spoke,4 God is also called Allah. Clement, and the Most Beneficent. In one of the hadiths of Prophet Muhammad"
"I worship Allah alone, He has No partener, He is not fetish, inanimate, person, animals or anything, He is  2:255]   Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave ? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.  [59:22]  He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful.   [59:23]  He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, the Compeller, the Superb. Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him).   [59:24]  He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.   [112:1] Say: He is Allah, the One!  [112:2] Allah, the eternally Besought of all!  [112:3] He begetteth not nor was begotten.  [112:4] And there is none comparable unto Him.    [24:35]   Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a shining star. (This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will. And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things.    [24:36]   (This lamp is found) in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered therein. Therein do offer praise to Him at morn and evening.    [24:37]   Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned;    [24:38]   That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did, and increase reward for them of His bounty. Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will.    [24:39]   As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught, and findeth, in the place thereof, Allah Who payeth him his due; and Allah is swift at reckoning.    [24:40]   Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light, for him there is no light.    [24:41]   Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise, and the birds in their flight ? Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do.    [24:42]   And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the journeying.    [24:43]   Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds, then gathereth them, then maketh them layers, and thou seest the rain come forth from between them; He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, and smiteth therewith whom He will, and averteth it from whom He will. The flashing of His lightning all but snatcheth away the sight.    [24:44]   Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night. Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for those who see.    [24:45]   Allah hath created every animal of water. Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs and (a kind) that goeth upon four. Allah createth what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.    [24:46]   Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.    [24:47]   And they say: We believe in Allah and the messenger, and we obey; then after that a faction of them turn away. Such are not believers.    [24:48]   And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them, lo! a faction of them are averse;    [24:49]   But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly.    [24:50]   Is there in their hearts a disease, or have they doubts, or fear they lest Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgment ? Nay, but such are evil-doers.    [24:51]   The saying of (all true) believers when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them is only that they say: We hear and we obey. And such are the successful.    [24:52]   He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger, and feareth Allah, and keepeth duty (unto Him): such indeed are the victorious.    [24:53]   They swear by Allah solemnly that, if thou order them, they will go forth. Say: Swear not; known obedience (is better). Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do.    [24:54]   Say: Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if ye turn away, then (it is) for him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged, and for you (to do) only that wherewith ye have been charged. If ye obey him, ye will go aright. But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly.    [24:55]   Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will surely make them to succeed (the present rulers) in the earth even as He caused those who were before them to succeed (others); and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them, and will give them in exchange safety after their fear. They serve Me. They ascribe no thing as partner unto Me. Those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the miscreants.    [24:56]   Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply ye may find mercy.    [24:57]   Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Fire will be their home - a hapless journey’s end!    [5:109]  In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers, and saith: What was your response (from mankind) ? they say: We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden,   [5:110]  When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it and it was a bird by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from (harming) thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed: This is naught else than mere magic;   [5:111]  And when I inspired the disciples, (saying): Believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered (unto Thee) ""we are muslims"".   [5:112]  When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven ? He said: Observe your duty to Allah, if ye are true believers.   [5:113]  (They said:) We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts and know that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that thereof we may be witnesses.   [5:114]  Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers.   [5:115]  Allah said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures.   [5:116]  And when Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind: Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah ? he saith: Be glorified! It was not mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it, then Thou knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden ?   [5:117]  I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them, and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over all things.   [5:118]  If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them (lo! they are Thy slaves). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise.   [5:119]  Allah saith: This is a day in which their truthfulness profiteth the truthful, for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are secure for ever, Allah taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the great triumph.   [5:120]  Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is therein, and He is Able to do all things.     ,"

Nothing to do with climate change. Why do you want to believe otherwise?

"The German European Commission together with the EU Injustice Tribunal in Luxembourg declared World War III on Poland - now economic, energy and food from 2020. Macron, Brussels, tsue have their share and purpose in this - the destruction of the Polish judiciary, the order to demoralize Children, (Demoralization of Children is their killing - annihilation of the Polish nation - this is Germany's goal) by closing mines in Poland overnight, limiting agricultural production . France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, the EU Commission are silent on the obligation to provide immediate financial assistance to Poland, for over 2 million war refugees from Ukraine admitted to Polish apartments, and not to camps - as in Germany. From 28/03/2022, the German eu commission - the hypocrites - kindly allow Poland - to transfer budget funds from the investment - to consumption - to help refugees !!! - instead of immediately give a special financial pool !!!. Earlier, they demanded from Poland a fine of 50,000 euros for each unaccepted Arab immigrant - invited by Merkel. German Chancellor Scholtz (leftist): ""he cannot impose sanctions on Russia overnight,"" - colleague Putin. But the same German EU and German tribunal of injustice in Luxembourg imposed a financial penalty on Poland in the amount of 1.5 million euros a day for - having its own law and judiciary in Poland, for not closing - overnight - lignite mines - powering power plants, for not admitting to schools deviants. That's over 200 days x 1.5 million euros a day =? Germany and Putin - they came up with a green deal with Putin to limit agricultural production (10% of CO2 emissions - from the EU) to plunge Poland economically, legally, with depravation, force Poland to switch to Russian gas, starve Poland. Seeing such destruction of the EU - England left the German union. Ukraine - do not enter such a - Russian-German ideological European Union!"

"provide untampered, empirical and direct evidence for that claim"
The climate is always changing look at the history of the earth . It was changing before people.
selling us construction errors for climate crisis. Get a life.
"I got some news for you, mate - the Earth's climate has ALWAYS been changing, ever since the Earth HAD a climate!  And it will continue to change, REGARDLESS of these headbanging politicians and their ""drive to net zero"".  The idea that we can overcome the power of the Sun is utter lunacy. You want to know what REAL climate change looks like?  Take a look at the pictures linked to, below, taken in the Peak District of England.  Do you know what carved out those valleys, about 10,000 years ago?  GLACIERS!! Back then, the ice cap over central England was about a MILE THICK.  And now it's all gone. Now run along, cuddle your fluffy bunny, and don't worry your fluffy little head about the weather changing, as it does, from one week to the next, and one year to the next. Wetter, drier, wetter, drier, warmer, cooler, warmer, cooler - as it has been doing for God knows how many hundreds of millions of years . . ."

"Nothing mother Nature here, total human failures, Leave the dams for the beaver"
That's what I call a flash flood !! Lol
I can’t decide which is worse… The damn failures or the ridiculous music!

No such thing as climate change. Weather is always different each day. Get used to it. Thanks from.St. Paul Minnesota.
"Lmao what the hell does a dam failure have to do with climate change 😆. Has nothing to do with changes in temperature, they just fail because of construction issues"
So man made dam failures r now climate change 🤣

Yea climate change isn’t real for one we do not control the rotation of the planet we also do not control how close we get to the sun every year that is Mother Nature n the galaxy doing their thing we can’t control that and for the people who believe that the ozone layer has holes in it if our ozone layer had even the tiniest hole the size of a penny we’d all be dead by the radiation so notice science is wrong about lots of things n one of them is climate change our planet changes all the time we do not control it
the consequences of harming good nature are hard
7:20 nice water mark cover. Good to know you enjoy stealing content
Some of these may be “natural disasters” but they all seem to have happened as a result of man trying to harness the forces of nature rather than climate change. Don’t get me wrong I’m no climate change disbeliever but if we are going to try and harness renewable energy through hydro electricity we have to acknowledge that there is an environmental impact and that we need to be sure we have the technology and engineering and construction right .
The fake man made climate change lie again. None of whats on this video was caused by climate change at all!
"AHH....je moet er echt voor geleerd hebben om zo een dam in te laten storten op deze manier...en hoewel het een spectaculair gezicht is, zijn mijn gedachte altijd bij de slachtoffers, die het volle vertrouwen hadden in deze gigantische bouwwerken...R.I.P........"
You spelled Natural wrong it's spelled Man Made.

How is it a natural disaster if its a man made dam that collapses
WTF has any of this to do with climate change? Reservoirs have always been risky and some have always failed. One of these is a well documented turbine failure at a hydro electric plant. Most others are structural dam failures due to poor design or maintenance. Floods due to periodic bad weather which are no doubt ‘the worse since 1995’ or similar.
Dam……. That failed

Dams are still good 👏
Nobody is saying that dams are bad. Dams are very good for our energy grid for economy and to keep people working. But when these companies build these dams with the lowest bidder and the cheapest material and the worst laborers that don’t really know what they’re doing you have these accidents. A majority of these dams that broke were due to human failure not natural failure.
I know it sounds stupid but can that much water have an impact in Ocean and sea level?
All filmed with a potato.

"1:33 this dam is a curse for colombia it has a lot of death bodies in his bottom under the waters, the boddies are from the families women and childrens killed for opossing to the dam construction with out being relocated, so the goverment of Uribe and his illegal armed arm with ""paramilitars""with the oficial army help  killed all those peope with help of druglords and buried them in the bottom of the dam, then proceded to fill the dam as quick as they can to hide the crimes and by that is this disaster that came as result of rush things to hide those crimes against humanity. If u dont belive me just look up for this fact: 2094 people was reported as victims of enforced disappearance in the influence area of Hidroituango dam. All of this is oficial data from special jurisdiction for peace in Colombia. So next time u ask why war in colombia this is one of the answers. Our goverment like to practice genocide in hispopulation with total impunity. That is the seed that feed the rest of the crimes in the country, violence produce more violence, and the root of all blood rivers in colombia came from goverment then it grows to the society producing drug lords and guerrillas that born to defence themselfs from gov bombers in the 60s and today lost his patch and are not more than simple organized crime, but know that all that messy shit guerrillas, drug dealers, paramilitars, organized crime, piracy all of that born in the gov and his practice of genocide with impunity present even as today 2022. Violence grow more violence right? Plz put an eye on Colombia is about to left all thats hit in the past."

Saying this is result of climate change IS irresponsible.
"@Olly O  How will it form again at the coolest part? Something has to absorb heat from the water before it can become ice. What will absorb the heat if the ambient temperature is increasing and considering the H2O has the highest heat capacity? In strictly chemical terms, the reaction of heat moving from water to air (to form ice) is naturally highly unfavorable if the air temperature is increasing. You need cool air to form ice, not an already existing block of ice that will magically form more ice when in contact with water."
"@Olly O Some people don't have the brain capacity to understand the Milankovicz Cycle, these people would rather have others think and decide for them while not doing a single thing, leaving themselves utterly clueless!"
"@Strafniki in roman times southern englands average annual temps were similar to the south of france ...or indeed italy, the ice caps must have retreated further north back in the day, why? no man-made pollution to cause any global disturbance? or maybe it was a milankovicz  cycle? and were are living through one ourselves and have to ability to record it...and use it for other gains...but thats another story."
"Help keep comments respectful? All this has to do with construction failures, no climate changes."

"YOU!!!. . . . are the cause of climate change, because you refuse to REPENT!!! The only thing that will stop climate change is when everyone repents. World wide repentance is not far away, and when it happens, you will see the restoration of the planet that you will NEVER ever accomplish!"
The majority of these incidents had little to do with Nature or climate change!!!!!!!!!
Climate change?  Your own descriptions said shoddy construction.   Dams break. Period.

There is nothing new happening on earth today which was not foretold.  My prayer is for the chosen people and the world. Those who can Repent their sins while they can, to do that."

@Moon Pix 24 x 7 at the time of monsoon idukki dam would be at its highest capacity what will we do at that time?.secondly mullaperiyaar is situated in Kerala territory ....and tn afraid of building new dam by Kerala gov it will affect your politics and also tn couldn't have any role in dam....just remember that when it collapsed only tn would have the problems ..you cant never get water.and you cant build a dam in Kerala teritory
"You have idukki dam below the mullai periyar dam. That is newly constructed.  Second thing allow tamil nadu government to reconstruct and own rights to maintain mullai periyar dam. Thirdly, ask tamilnadu to construct dam inside their terrority because two small river that are main source of water for mullai periyar originates within tamilnadu"

Then the flood swept them away when they were unjust. 15》 Then We saved him and the people of the ark; and We made it a warning to the universe. .... 40》 So We seized each one for his sin: There were some upon whom We sent a hurricane; there were some that the Cry seized; there were some which We caused to be swallowed up by the earth; and there were some that We drowned. However, Allah is not such as to wrong them; but they have wronged themselves.  41》 Those who have taken protectors besides Allah are like the spider who made himself home. But the most fragile house is that of the spider.

"Kerala is right in the middle of floods , mud sliding  aggravated by human beings which has no connection with any dam.

"You can't seriously blame all these on ""climate change""? That's exactly the reason people don't believe climate change is real, some of these dams were constructed  before climate change was even an issue. Most others were abandoned dams, they were going to fail at some point in time on their own. Others were mistakes made during construction. It's this exact thinking that everything that happens now is due to climate change is the exact reason people don't believe anything is wrong. You can't blame everything on climate change, get real.  ***When their beach house floods, they will know it's real, but until then, they will continue to deny it."

this is not climate change !!!  this is alien attack
"Thus says The Lord: Blood pours down, a waterfall of tears flow down! Rivers of tears and blood run through the desolate places, yet no growth is seen; nothing at all sprouts forth from the hard and cracked ground! The sound of the charadrion is not heard, neither do the doves come out of their hiding places in the morning; no song is heard... Blood pours down to cover the mountains! Blood pours down and tears cover the land! Blood and tears fall upon the parched ground, yet only dust and ashes remain. The earth cries out in the morning, and the people mourn at eventide; from dusk until the dawn, the bodies are piled up in heaps! The whole world loves violence, and over all this murder barely a tear is shed; the voice of weeping and lamentation is rarely heard above a whisper. And the cries of every unborn child is muffled by the sound of their mother’s dying womb, as her heart becomes stone... The light of her eyes darkening; her life, forfeit. Mankind is covered in wickedness! The breadth of the whole earth is filled with every kind of evil! Every tree is dry and bears bitter fruit! For the heart of man is black, the void within him deep, a widening chasm filled with deep darkness, sheer cliffs on every side!... Every branch withers, no more will leaves appear, dry and dead branches ready to be broken off and cast into the fire. The heart of The Lord your God is very heavy. The heart of The Lord is enraged, and is very heavy. The sorrow of The Lord is deep and infinite. My people, let it be known to you, I take no pleasure at all in what I must do, in what must be done - NO PLEASURE AT ALL! Says The Lord. As My hand draws back, blood pours down! As I strike the earth in My anger, My tears run down! As famine spreads forth across the land, My heart is rent inside Me over the hardness of men’s hearts! As My face fills with the heat of My fury, My eyes are set ablaze with fire over that which I see! My tears run down, My blood pours down. As My own servants turn from Me and run, as My own beloved, whom I have called sons and daughters, turn and fight against Me, as My own body betrays Me, My blood pours down, My tears run down.  As the nations come together and bind My hands and My feet, My tears run down...  As they bruise Me and spit in My eyes, While mocking Me, My tears run down...  As they pierce My side, My blood and Tears run down together!...  As My own people drive in the nails still, I am risen up from My place with My arms Spread apart, waiting to receive them! My blood runs down, the tears run down... OH MY PEOPLE, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?!  Hard generation! Sleeping children! Even My own fall asleep, unable to watch with Me for one hour; their hearts hardened, unwilling to weep with Me in this last hour. Do you not understand My sorrows, little flock? They refuse to be healed! Therefore, I must destroy them!... My blood runs down, and they refuse it! My tears fall like rain upon the nations, yet they will not lift their head, nor do they hold out their tongue to drink it! Where have all My children gone?! They choose death! THEY CHOOSE DEATH! And at the last day, they shall surely receive it; they shall taste of it to the fullest! Therefore do My tears run down; therefore do the rivers run like death through the waste places. Beloved, they heap up death, only to throw themselves upon the heap! Lo, they have made their covenant with death, and with the grave they are in agreement! They burn candles and make sacrifices to other gods; yea, they bow down to them! Behold, they shall be slaughtered and burned together!... The whole field is diseased, every leaf is blighted and withers, every stalk is rotten even to the roots! It must be purged and burned with fire! Therefore do My tears run down; therefore does My sorrow continue on, forever. The wound is incurable! Therefore My love will weep, and My heart will wail, forever. Have you not read My words, little flock? Are your ears yet dull in hearing? Yet My words shall not return void. For the beasts of the earth languish, and the creatures of flight fail to soar, for they know what is coming. Lo, I have nourished and brought forth young children to weep in your places, for you were unwilling. And still the mighty stand proud, and the feeble follow close behind in their example, refusing to bow down, covering themselves in pretense while wearing many disguises, until the face they behold in the mirror has become unrecognizable to them.  THEY DO NOT KNOW ME!... My blood runs down, yet I do not know them! My tears run down, yet My own people remain Unclean, hiding always in their deceitful houses!...  From the least to the greatest, I tell you, They have surely hated Me!...  Therefore I am come down to take My spoil, To purge and to slaughter! Blood and fire! Rivers of blood and pillars of smoke!... This world is condemned, And The Father has declared its end!... I AM COME DOWN![1]...

Those poor animals.
20 years ago it seemed there was a disaster somewhere in the world like these once every few months or once a year not about everyday. Is this bad journalism or are we really being punished for our negligence and carelessness.
We are in End Times. Look around they shut the whole world down only to reemerge as the NWO.

"Amazing how pipelines get a bad rap in lieu of the probability of a leak, which new procedures and technology safeguards against to a higher degree than dam construction and yet I see many of these “greener “ energy processes built even recently have an even more devastating outcome. Hmmm, where’s Greta and her preaching on dam destruction?"
Thats quagmire 💪
"This is the climate truth.  In the last 1000 years the world has  experienced 180,000,000 human deaths due to starvation. (list of  famines -- Wikipedia) Much of it caused by a loss of sunlight, colder  temperatures, and droughts, which destroyed  planted crops and crop  harvesting. It happened because we are in an ice age. We still have a  huge amount of glaciers. The CO2 content in our atmosphere was a  constant 200 to 300 ppm. An all-time lowest level. Now we are finally  approaching 400 ppm. Up from 300 ppm since 1950. During the Dinosaurs,  CO2 content was 1 thousand to 3 thousand parts per million. Long  before that 7000 ppm. From 7000 ppm to 200 ppm with the average  temperature dropping from 72 to 52 degrees. We are now 54 degrees.    Our average temperature has raised 1.4 degrees since 1880. More carbon  emissions cause warmer temperatures, more rains, more storms, more  winds, and healthier plants. A longer growing season will produce a  much larger harvest. Even if it only gains a few more warm   days. Every  farmer knows this when buying corn seed which always advertises both,  bushels per acre and growing season lengths. Although the oceans will  rise again, eventually. In 5000 years or more, all the coastal land  lying below 200 feet elevation may be covered with water. Sea level  has raised 3 inches in the last 30 years. 6 to 8 inches total since  1880. The forecast is; a 2 1/2 feet rise in 100 years.  Greta and many  liberals don't think they will survive.  &  Gore put $300 MILLION into his pocket with the GW and CC scams.  You did notice this, didn't you?  While he was preaching about Global Warming, his projected temperature change didn't take place.  The polar ice cap that was supposed to be gone by 2000 was actually larger!  Presto-Change-o:  With a quick shift, GW became ""Climate Change"".  With this clever maneuver (e.g. manure), it didn't matter what the climate did at all; Gore and his shysters would always get it right.  Now, the world is filled with ""scientists"" who earned their degrees by preaching CC.  After earning their degrees, they now earn their paychecks because of CC.  How many people are going to deliberately talk themselves out of a paycheck?  To top it off, we have the ""cancel culture"" crowd making sure that the right message is being broadcast.  Any real scientists having doubts about CC are simply relieved of their careers.  Note that the only scientists speaking against CC waited until they retired to start spreading the truth.  If it takes the ""cancel culture"" or ""thought police"" to promote an idea, we know immediately that it's a scam."
"Nothing here had anything to do with natural disasters or climate change,  as proclaimed in the headline,  and goes even further to totally discredit climate-alarmists who'll grab at any straw to continue their home-grown myth that allows them to believe they're saving the world."
What a stupidity talking of climate Change. So Fed Up of this hype....😭

Humans only want to Damn the River to make it work for them, generating electricity or storing toxic waste.   Humans Are Not Beavers.   go figure, human dams don't work all that well."
"!!!  ALLERT  !!!  Be sure if you have Holy Spirit dwelling in you with evidence of Speaking In tongues!! Holy Spirit in you is SEAL that you bellong to God, whoever doesnt have that mark in them when JESUS comes second time in these end times cannot be saved or raptured, but left behind!! John 3:5-8, John 4:24, 2 korintians 1:22  HOW TO RECEIVE HOLY SPIRIT ?  Acts 2:38 (So clear)    1.) !!  REPENT  !!  That means get convicted that you are in sin and in rebellion towards GOD, confess all sins to GOD, ask forgivnes with honest Heart in tears and DO NOT SIN ANYMORE!! Parallely Realize what JESUS did for you and all humanity giving his perfect Life in perfect love for all of you to set you FREE FROM SIN which leads to hell!!  ( John the baptist preached  REPENT for the kingdom of God is near (Mathew 3:2) , and first word from JESUS mouth when He started to preach was  REPENT for the kingdom od God is near  (Mathew  4:17) ).   2.) BAPTISE IN THE NAME OF JESUS FOR REMISSION OF YOUR SINS   That means that somebody with Holy Spirit baptise you in the name of JESUS, like everybody in bible are baptised in the name of JESUS, cause name JESUS set us free and wash away our sins!! ) Acts 2:38, Acts 10:48, Acts 19:5, Acts 22:16, Romans 6:3 and whole chapter 6 in Romans is POWERFULL.    3.)  RECEIVE HOLY SPIRIT AND START TO SPEAK IN TONGUES  (  That means that somebody pray for you to get Holy spirit and start to speak in tongues, and if you are sincere honest heart in your decision to follow JESUS,  He will for sure send you his Spirit, cause it is promise of GOD for everbody!  Acts 2:4, Acts 8:17, Acts 10:45-46, Acts 19:6 )   4.) CONTINUE LIVING HOLY WITH HOLY SPIRIT, OBEYING HIM !  (  Connect and be led by the Holy spirit, start to grow in faith, preach the gospel, heal the sick, cast out demons, baptise other in water and with Holy spirit, disciple them to do the same! ( Example about living holy with Holy spirit: Romans 8, first Peter 1:16, first John 3:1-10, Second Thesselonians 2:13, Gallatians 5:22.   Example  What should we do?? Like Jesus send apostoles and other disciples, now JESUS send us for this last days! Luke 9:1-6, Luke 10:1-20,  )   After All:  If someone wants to grow more spiritually, wants quidance about  Healings, Casting out demons, baptism with water and Holy spirit or have any questions, put your comments here with your mail and i will contact you."

Climate Change is in your f--ked up  mind
A dam which is not constructed properly causes so much damage
)
"The first event shown had absolutely nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with the callous disregard for the safety of human life by the company. Then we have the dam collapsing in Colombia - again nothing to do with climate change. The incident with the Russian dam was caused by the authorities ignoring essential maintenance and regular inspections of the turbines. Nothing to do with climate change. The failure of part of the wall on the Texan dam had nothing to do with climate change and all to do with age and deterioration of the concrete. The collapse of the Sardoba dam wall was due to years of mismanagement and lack of cooperation between the respective governments responsible for water management in that region. In regard to the Midland dams, the failure was, and I quote from the official report, "".....inextricably linked with two, and possibly three, key parties that were responsible for the dam’s  management and oversight."" Historical rainfall exacerbated the situation. Finally, the collapse of the Mariana tailings dam in 2015 was, in a very similar way to the first example in this video, totally due to the company's utter lack of care and complete disregard for human life. In summary, few, if any, of the examples shown here are due to ""climate change""."

"Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God's name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: ""God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life"" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Youtube Channel : Living Waters"

"Repent for rejecting Jesus as your God because he is coming. The next viruses of Devil people, micochip, one world religion/policy of them etc. are approaching. After the World War 3 Jesus will rescue the world and cleanse it from devil people and demons. Before that there will be a warning for all humanity, a luminous cross in the scy after two asteroids collide. One week later you will be shown your sins in illumination of conscience.About this mother Mary says in numreous apparitions: Luz de Maria, Gisella Cardia, Pedro Regis, Father Michael Rodrigue. By then everyone will know Jesus is the true God.  Islam, Buddism, Hindu were man made or rather devil made religions. One third of humanity will die as decribed in the Apocalipse and in Mattew in the Bible. God bless you"

"The sad truth is, all of these disasters can be laid at the feet of greed. greedy corporations build dams then don't do proper maintenance, or in the case of the one just finished, they go cheap during construction to save a few bucks. Dams cost huge to build properly and they cost to maintain, many corporations the own dams don't put the money into maintaining them.  Never mind the massive environmental damage from building one."
"Why is it always corporate greed where it comes to commodities provided by corporations that people like you require to be comfortable? Corporations would exist if you didn’t buy their products so if you hate them than leave your car, house and everything you own and move to the forest"
Nice rhetoric there. Got any facts to back it up?
"1:33 this dam is a curse for colombia it has a lot of death bodies in his bottom under the waters, the boddies are from the families women and childrens killed for opossing to the dam construction with out being relocated, so the goverment of Uribe and his illegal armed arm with ""paramilitars""with the oficial army help  killed all those peope with help of druglords and buried them in the bottom of the dam, then proceded to fill the dam as quick as they can to hide the crimes and by that is this disaster that came as result of rush things to hide those crimes against humanity. If u dont belive me just look up for this fact: 2094 people was reported as victims of enforced disappearance in the influence area of Hidroituango dam. All of this is oficial data from special jurisdiction for peace in Colombia. So next time u ask why war in colombia this is one of the answers. Our goverment like to practice genocide in hispopulation with total impunity. That is the seed that feed the rest of the crimes in the country, violence produce more violence, and the root of all blood rivers in colombia came from goverment then it grows to the society producing drug lords and guerrillas that born to defence themselfs from gov bombers in the 60s and today lost his patch and are not more than simple organized crime, but know that all that messy shit guerrillas, drug dealers, paramilitars, organized crime, piracy all of that born in the gov and his practice of genocide with impunity present even as today 2022. Violence grow more violence right? Plz put an eye on Colombia is about to left all thats hit in the past."

"The climate has been changing in cycles for the last four and a half billion years and will continue to do so until the day when our sun goes super nova. Hopefully before that happens, the one truly important race (the human race)will have long since figured what to do in such an event. As far as the political version of climate change (aka leftist propaganda to gain more control over the people) goes, I wouldn't worry about it too much. There is no actual/verifiable evidence that would suggest any kind of climate catastrophe in the next 300-400 years so relax. We're all going to be just fine."
"4 It was destroyed, the earth fell; got sick, the world fell; the high peoples of the earth fell ill. 5 And the land was polluted under its inhabitants; because they broke the laws, they distorted the law, they broke the everlasting covenant. 6 For this reason the curse consumed the land, and its inhabitants were laid waste; for this cause the inhabitants of the earth were consumed, and men were diminished. 7 The wine is lost, the vine is sickened, all who were merry in heart groaned. 8 The rejoicing of the tambourines has ceased, the noise of those rejoicing has ceased, the joy of the harp has ceased. 9 They will not drink wine with singing; cider will be bitter to those who drink it. 10 The city is broken by vanity; every house has been closed, so that no one can enter. 11 There are cries for lack of wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, joy is banished from the earth. 12 The city was desolate, and the gate was broken down with ruin. 13 For so it shall be in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the peoples, like a shaken olive tree, like gleanings after the harvest. Isaiah 24: 4-13. - 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; See that you are not disturbed, because it is necessary that all this happens; but the end is not yet.7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be plagues, and famines, and earthquakes in different places. 8 And all this will be the beginning of pain. Matthew 24: 6-8 JESUS. - 26 “Just as it happened in the time of Noah, so it will be when the Son of man comes. 27 They ate, they drank, and they married and gave in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark; then the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 “The same thing happened in Lot's time: they ate and drank, bought and sold, sowed and built. 29 But the day Lot left '' ""'(Sodom)""' '' it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 “So it will be on the day the Son of man is revealed. Luke 17: 26-30 JESUS - 9 And when you hear of wars and seditions (protests against their rulers), do not be alarmed; because it is necessary that these things happen first; but the end will not be immediately. 10 Then he said to them: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; 11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in different places famines and pestilences; and there will be terror and great signs from heaven. Luke 21: 7-11 - 12 and because wickedness has multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations; And then the end will come. Matthew 24: 12-14 - 22 And if those days were not shortened, no one would be saved; but because of the elect, those days will be shortened. Matthew 24:22 JESUS - 8 But God shows his love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ JESUS ​​died for us. 9 For much more, being already justified in his blood, by him we will be saved from wrath. 10 For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life. Romans 5: 8-10 --- 16 “Because God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son (JESUS), so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but may have eternal life. John 3:16 - 18 Come quickly, says the Lord, and let us be aware: if your sins are like scarlet, they will be white as snow; if they are red like crimson, they will be like white wool. Isaiah 1:18 - 9 that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart it is believed for righteousness, but with the mouth it is confessed for salvation.  Romans 10: 9-10 --23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23 - 12 And in no one else is there salvation; for there is no other name under heaven, given to men, by which we can be saved. Acts 4: 11-12 - 10 so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth; 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Philippians 2: 10-11 - 12 But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God; John 1:12 - 23 Jesus answered and said to him, Whoever loves me will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him. John 14:23 - 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; because the Father also seeks such worshipers to be adored. 24 God is Spirit; and those who adore him, in spirit and in truth it is necessary that they adore. John 4: 23-24 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you; I do not give it to you as the world gives it. Not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

first break was a serious construction disaster . not  a natural one .        normal  ground can never hold back so much water because it saturates the soil too much . when it is soggy enough it will slide away .    they forgot the part that separates the water mass from getting into the  soil   .
tbh they all are!

"The majority of these incidents had little to do with Nature or climate change. Just man getting it wrong! BTW, Oroville dam did not collapse, nor was it in any way damaged. The spillway failed due to poor construction."
"@Mazza Marsden Congrats, you flunked basic science. But you probably wholeheartedly believe in a great flood unleashed by a bearded sky fairy you call Daddy."
I thought the same thing.  Engineering mistakes and poor maintenance.  Everyone should look up the Vajont Dam disaster in Italy in the 1960s; perfect example of fatal engineering and greed 😢
Those darn cow farts..  Or perhaps the sun has much more to do with the weather then the paid* scientists will admit.
Qué será lo que está pasando en este mundo

"Forget this ""climate change"" - HAARP and Chemtrails - AND BAD PEOPLE"
"Dios ko? So scary, New subcriber frnd done me here.."
"Come on, these are not disasters, these are humanity mistakes, omissions, corruption, two of these were here, in Brazil, and there's more """"accidents"""" that can happen, Mariana and Brumadinho were the ""signs"" that here, we have problems with rich companies, the government doesn't seem to care about it. Mariana was horrible for the living things around the mineral re-deposits, 19 died there... Brumadinho was horrible too, more than  300 died, the hole city is sick now, they're leaving the town...  We have to look different to this, cause we know, it could be avoided"
I moved out of the valley for this reason. I was down stream from 3 dams and a big volcano.
Which place
Very wise
Lucky you did take care

Theses disasters weren’t cause by climate change. They were done by humans trying to control how the water was controlled and it wasn’t meant to be that way.
I think all dams breaking is by sabotage by a group of terrorists in Boston MA fbi agency Chuy Cortez group with albinos. Stealth hover crafts used.

Why it’s hotter at the equator if it’s tilted?
@Earth Rocks! thanks!!
More overall sunlight received there throughout the year as twice (equinoxes) it's getting direct sunlight and between the equinoxes it's never more than 23.5° away from direct sunlight.

"I took 2yrs of astronomy in high school…planetarium and all.  Yes, I got an “A” in that class.  But I still can’ reconcile this: If N hemisphere is tilted TOWARDS sun in summer, and yet earth is then 3million miles FURTHER from sun at that time than in winter, then why do the N and S poles have VERY different average temps?  They SHOULD be practically the same and not 50F colder in Antarctic on average.  Also, if it’s the angle and not the distance that makes the season, shouldn’t there be a HUGE temperature range from morning to noon to night?  It should be HUGE…every day.  There should not be ANY days with even temps throughout the day.  Nobody can explain this yet.  Not even my Astronomy teacher, and then he passed away RIP."
"Concise, precise ! To the point ! Thanks !"
great video
"I went through 3 videos prior and nothing. Usually a crap ton of unnecessary information and showing off knowledge. You on the other hand, direct EASY information. Ty ÷]"
You didn't rotate the earth. I wanted to see a full visual demonstration but you kept America in the sun all day and night.
"You are so good at explaining, thank you. And your computer simulator looks great! Is it publicly available?  I have always wanted to find a nice compilation of (some of) the different cultural rituals you can find across the globe, from thousands of peoples, related to the important dates of solstices and equinoxes. Would you be interested in doing it?"

"Does the Earths orbit round the Sun have a cycle. Is there ever a time that the Earth is closest to the Sun in June/July, if so we would be in big dodo as regards global warming as there is way more land mass in the Northern hemisphere.???"

"So the earth moves like a snake, good to know."
Great video!  Thanks!
"Truly Knowledgeable.. But in case of march 22 , in southern Hemisphere season may summer! Can someone explain!!       btw love from 🇮🇳❤"
"The start and end of seasons will vary based on your local climate. This video just describes the equinoxes and solstices and when the most and least sun hits the surface of an area. Understanding the tilt of the Earth also explains the changes in general wind patterns and precipitation.   There are plenty of other factors that impact seasonal changes in weather in an area, including monsoons (changing winds and how they interact with local mountain systems). And seasonal changes will be more extreme the further you travel from the equator."
Enjoying our winter under the African Sun 😎🇿🇼
How come the earth is tilted the same from January to December
"The earth is on a permanent tilt - it doesn't change. What does change, is the earth's tilt with respect to the earth's position in its orbit around the sun. Perhaps you need to watch the video again?"
Mind blown   Jan is closest to sun  While July is furtherest
"This is all good and dandy except for thing....the north star...it never moves....but if we tilt 23.4 degrees in winter, and same in opposite direction for summer....seems to me that the north star would have to be in a differrnt spot ...but its always in same place..."
"@Earth Rocks! so your saying, theres no tilt during the winter and summer soltice? Its amazing how this spherical earth works..basically, just make up the rules to make it work ..if something doesnt proove out, then just change it so it fits...thats awesome....i get it..well, not really,"
"Tilt direction doesn't change over in our lifetimes -- stays the same. Always the north rotational pole pointing toward polaris. That's why, as we rotate around our axis, Polaris remains in the center of that rotation when viewed in the northern hemisphere."
"but if we tilt 23.4 degrees...  We are not tilting at all. That tilt is constant, and it doesn't change in a short period (couple hundred years).   What does change, is orientation of that tilt in relation to the Sun."
it kinda rotates. lol the north star rotates
It’s literally perfect!!
This might be a stupid question but what did the pink line around the earth represent?
"@Earth Rocks! Yes, this is the line that kenny is referring to."
"It would help if you could give me a timestamp, so I can tell what line you're talking about. If it's what I think it is, it's just a random latitude chosen to provide an example of how someone would experience the seasons."
thank u. It really helped me .
Yet there are still flat-earthers
"Very interesting theory. I think there was another thing to mention that you didn't and that is, the impact of the distance between the Earth and the Sun during the soltices. The question is: Does the southern hemisphere experience a stronger summer day (heat intensity, light, uvs, etc), on december 22, at 23.5 degrees, southern latitude (tropic of capricorn) that what the northern hemisphere experiences on 21 of june, at 23.5 degrees, northern latitude (tropic of cancer) owing to the fact that on december 22, the tropic of capricorn is actually closer to the Sun than the tropic of cancer is, on the 21 of june?"
@Apple YT For sure.
"@Sailor Man One answer would be that water has the main role in this issue in the sense that no matter how much heat is coming from the Sun, the water absorbs much of the heat with no problem."
"@Sailor Man well, I was right"
"@Apple YT The southern hemisphere contains only 32% (68% for the northern hemisphere) of the earth's landmass, which obviously means that the majority of the southern hemisphere is covered in water. The earth's oceans are a significant moderator of temperature, as they release and absorb heat energy far more slowly than land. This is why in fact, the southern hemisphere's seasons are LESS extreme than the northern hemisphere's, as there is less average temperature fluctuation between the seasons."
Amazing video. Loved the explanation
"This is the video I was looking for, very well explained 👌🏼"
This is one of the best explanations on YT
excellent explanation.thank you keep rocking mam
Very well done video delivering the maximum amount of information in a precise and manner that was easy to understand. Hats off to the Director and Narrator for the detailed research with a lot of moving parts. In this video format one can watch as many times as necessary.
What a lovely explaintation
Right cuz the earth is 90 million miles away and yet that slight tilt makes a temperature difference. Get real. U believe this BS. Brainwashed
"23 degrees is more than just a 'slight tilt', but of course, the seasons are easily explained in the flat earth model, right Armon?"
ur surprised that a sunset is much cooler than noon?
"What holds up the magical sun on flat earth, bro? Fishing line strung down from the dome?"
The intensity of sunlight hitting a surface is less when the light comes in at a shallow angle compared to when coming from higher above the horizon because the same amount of light in the first case is spread over a larger surface area.
"It rotates upside down, that's why sun goes from east to top and then in the west"
"Wrong. Try again, but this time use both of your brain cells."
"amazing lesson, I wish I had a teacher like this during geography classes in school. Thanks a lot"
at last year in physics i know the sesons due to tilt of earth
Lol.   We would expect if the heat source is closer it would be warmer.  Does that happen.  No.  Let me explain why.
"RAQIA, perhaps you should explain what causes the seasons in the flat earth model?"
"Please refute what science says.. really, if you have looked into it so thoroughly you should be able to explain what Science says and give hard factual numbers to back up your claim..  Just saying that its closer so it should be hotter doesn't explain it."
"its been a month, friend"
Ok. Explain why.
Thank you
I understand the seasons so well
You earned a subscriber
I wish this showed how the moon works in all this
"@keifmr If you want to see a video about the moon and what causes the phases, there are dozens of videos uploaded to youtube that explain this. Are you actually telling everyone that you don't know how to do a 'search' to find these videos?"
"@keifmr in winter. In the northern hemisphere, we are closer to the sun. Because the perhilion is in January."
@Apple YT I've just never seen a video about it and I'm wondering. And I was taught in school that in winter we were further away from the Sun. Not this
"@keifmr why would you want to know that, in a video all about seasons?"
@Apple YT I want to see how the moon reflects light from the sun
You are a great teacher
Glad you think so!
Are not the equinox points close to the sun compared to the solstice???
"@I am not a Journalist  Distance of Earth from the Sun is not responsible for seasons, and it affects weather with smaller magnitude than angle of Earth's rotational axis, since difference in distance during one orbit is only 3% of total distance of Earth from the Sun."
@Earth Rocks! May the exact distance of the earth at equinox and solstice points would help better 👍
"Typically the perspective of the diagrams make it appear that Earth's orbit is closer to the Sun during the equinoxes, but that's just because we're looking at a tilted view. If you look down onto the orbital plane from directly above the Sun, you'll see it as Max5250's response above describes."
"Equinox points?!  Axis of Earth's rotation is equally far away from the Sun during equinoxes, while during solstice's one end of rotational axis is closer, while the other is farther from the Sun."
"at 0:23 earth is tilted away from the sun. at 0:36, earth is now tilted towards the sun. which is it?"
@Apple YT Hello.
"@Sailor Man ahaha, hello."
Do you understand now?
"The Earth's rotational axis keeps pointing in _one_ direction as it orbits the Sun, as shown in the video from 0:35 to 0:52. When one pole is tilted _towards_ the Sun at one of the solstices, it will be tilting _away_ from the Sun 6 months later when the Earth has moved to the opposite side of its orbit."

I love fall...October. But seems it’s been changing where the leafs aren’t on the tree’s as long anymore and the fall weather isn’t around as much as it use to. Now it seems like it just goes from very hot to very cold within a week. During the spring the woods are growing in quicker than it did before. It’s April 23rd and the woods are already as full as it would been may 15th.
"Beijing Biden: True, and it would stay a nice high 40’s 50’s for a while instead of going from 90 degrees to -2 in a week. I’m an 80’s kid too."
Yea I agree. I live in Southern Illinois and usually late March we touch 70 degrees and through April 75 and by the end of thr month 80. Not anymore. It was freezing on April 30th. Had furnace on. From being a 80s kid I can tell you October did not have 90degree days and April wasn't 30 degrees.  Something has definitely changed.
"It's really illogical to represent objects in space with 2D lines, like in 0:32 where Earth axis is represented in 2D although it exists in 3D. As represented in that image axis is tilted 23.5 deg. in XY plane but has unknown Z coordinates."
What app did you download? To rotate earth
It's NASA animations -- public domain. I didn't build the animations of the spinning planet.
"So apparently we are being pulled by the sun at 590,000mph? So how do the man made satalites keep up with the ever moving solar system .?  Since when has moving closer to the sun  made it colder ?"
"@JudaismIslamUnited And still, you can't explain how the flat earth sun manages to remain the exact same angular size throughout the day, no matter what distance the sun is from the observer?"
"@JudaismIslamUnited  Car moves in medium called air, that is stationary. In what medium is Solar system?!"
@max5250  A car is a enclosed system.  Is the solar system a enclosed system?
"@JudaismIslamUnited  What exactly should prevent that satellite to move in different directions at different speeds? What prevents you to walk inside running train?  Conservation of momentum always apply, otherwise, there would be no casualties in car accidents."
"@max5250  How the fooook does conversation of momentum apply to a satalite which is apparently burning thrusters to move into a certain area of space at at the exact same time moving in a different direction at 540,000mph.   How the fooook can you have two different linear at the same time ?"
Very helpful
"Wow she kind of sounds like a smartass in the beginning when she asking does the northern hemisphere is hotter when it's tilted away from the sun in January and the way she says no kind of makes her sound like a smartass!  If you didn't notice then go back to the beginning when she asks that question. Timestamp is 1:10+ around 1:15+ is about where she asks the question is January our warmest season then with a smartass reply of no! It's no a big thing just sort of sounds like a smartass in a way, like someone would say and think that we should already know this and asking questions about it would be in a sarcastic tone as she gave!"
"Cool story bro, needs more dragons."
This video blows up my mind
explain this to retards flatearthers...
@Masyaf speaking about the sun..why is it a ball and the earth is a pizza?? WTF😂
What causes the Earth to tilt? And why? Since most scientists are atheists and say it’s by random chance. Also why is northern hemisphere further away from the sun in the summer but yet hotter… Wtf 😂
think they will buy it.. fat chance.
Perfect explanation! 👍🏾
Great illustration.
Wow
"I am really stuck as I have been researching this quite a bit lately ever since the huge massive coverage of the Canada and other Northern Winter conditions of Japan also, hearing and seeing the massive snow falls and icy conditions of the northern hemisphere.  I live in New Zealand, and our winters are mild in comparison, in between the tropics and ant arctic circles.  From this and other sources, the peak of the southern summer season is closest to the sun, and the opposite is true for the southern hemisphere winter, we are the furthest from the sun, yet we don't go through the massive winters that I've just seen Japan and Canada go through, it seems as though it is the opposite, and the northern hemisphere's have the hottest summers, and they are the furthest from the sun.  Can someone explain what I'm missing please???"
"@Anonymous Player Considering that there are skifields in the North Island, and that they are obviously covered in snow, why have you made the false statement that 'it only snows in the south island during winter but not in the north'?"
"@Sailor Man Yes people living in nz doesn't ski on snow, they only walk on snow if there was snow in mounatins"
"@Anonymous Player And yet, there are skifields in the North Island, but apparently the skiers don't actually ski on snow? Go figure?"
I also live in New Zealand and it only snows in the south island during winter but not in the north
"Location location location..  If I look at two locations at the same lattitude as myself... one 800 miles to the west and another 800 miles to the east.. They have drasitically different summers & winters than I experience, both temperature, precipitation & humidity.    Add that England which is further North than me, it has extermely more mild winters than my location.. It is because they are close to the ocean & get a steady inflow of mild ocean currents..   So location location location plays a big role in weather."
It was anti clockwise ! Right ? But you said clockwise. Why ?
Did you not hear that she said 'counter-clockwise'? This is another way of saying 'anti-clockwise'. The word 'counter' can mean to be 'the opposite of' something. You actually didn't know this?
"Sir, as per the video, Earth is much closer to sun during Equinox than Solstice which means heat should be more than summers because earth is close to sun during equinox times.  So the average heat of entire earth should be more than summers irrespective of hemispheres.  Secondly as per the study, the earth orbit is elliptical but sun is slightly towards one of the Solstice,  an oval shape earth orbit in which sun is not in the center of the orbit but the sun is more nearer to one of the solstice.  Please let me know my query"
"Johannes Kepler was the first to understand that the Earth and the other planets don't move in perfect circles, but in _ellipses_ and that the Sun isn't located at the centre, but at one of the two focal points. Each planet moves fastest when closest to the Sun and slowest when farthest away, but that difference is only about 3 % for Earth."
"I'm not sure why you've made mention of 'Earth is much closer to sun during Equinox', when in fact, it's only 3 % closer. The change in distance between the closest and furthest distances from the sun during the earth's elliptical orbit around the sun, is actually not that significant when it comes to the amount of the sun's energy reaching earth.  Also, too, the southern hemisphere is predominantly water, which means that seasonal temperature changes are somewhat moderated due to the fact that the oceans are very slow to change up or down in temperature, unlike a significant landmass such as North America, Europe and Asia."
"Crystalclear interpretation of 4 seasons (not Vivaldi's The Four Seasons violin concertos tho 😄), had the N-S division between fall and spring been explained also.  3:00 - the 'tropic of capricorn' is tilted counter-intuitively, unnecessarily, that can cause confusions."
Very very. usefull information! Thank you much!
"I see that this lesson was easier than school, but we have no chance"
"When the earth is closest to the sun during the Antarctic summer the Southern Hemisphere is both closer to the sun and experience long days. So why doesn't the Southern hemisphere below the 60th S parallel have any life? No trees, few plants, very few land species of insects, birds, or mammals. Compared to the Northern hemisphere which has millions of plant, insect and mammal and birds at the 60th N parallel?"
"@Sailor Man ok fine, but I got nothing else about Antartice to say, since I didn't plan to study too much on it. And you live in New Zealand right?"
@Anonymous Player Did you not think that it is common knowledge (something that is already well known) that Antarctica 'is basically ice'? Next you'll be telling everyone that the sun is incredibly hot? LOL.
@Sailor Man So you want me to tell u something u didn't know
"@Anonymous Player Yes it is, but you're not telling me something I didn't (or most people?) already know."
@Sailor Man Antarctica is basically ice
"That was an excellent video. One of the very few around that do the topic justice. Certainly the best of its kind. Congratulations, you rock!"
Great Video! (Jesimiel Millar Fernåndez) 1M1K340
"Fun fact: we know where is the up side and bottom side of ball because it relative position to the floor and the roof. But human don't know ""the floor"" and ""the roof"" of universe. So we can't say for sure wich parts of the earth that on top side or bottom side at this very moment."
"You are correct - there is no 'top' or 'bottom' to the universe. However, as a simple undisputed reference point, it is now considered that the north pole is the 'top' of the earth."
Can you be my teacher?
You see the simulation sun in this video? when you imagine it? Isn't that pretty gigantic when you at the sky and see the sun?
"Similarly, when you look at the moon you're looking at an area roughly the size of the Asian continent. Also, the moon and sun appear similarly sized in our sky, due to their relative distance and mass."
That was the best video I have ever watched!
Super explanation. Very well done!
"This is what kills me with flat earthers, they just need a basic 5th grade education to realize this can’t be made up. And instead of taking 2min to watch a video they’ll go their whole life being ignorant."
"At the blog address below, you can read the latest discovery regarding Heliocentric Theory.                                                 The blog is in Polish.

The signs of the zodiac and the rotation of the Earth annihilate Heliocentrism and anticipate Niebocentrism."
"My information is based on data provided by science. The Earth's rotation axis preces at the speed of the 1st degree for 72 years. This information has been known for thousands of years. The full precession period is almost 26,000 years. This is the fundamental quantity associated with this phenomenon. The rest is math and geometry. The laws in these branches of mathematics are also fixed and fully binding. What is bad is the system that uses them to its advantage. In my study, everything is calculated based on these principles. I also indicate where there are logical deviations from them."
"@Sailor Man Sorry, I got it wrong. I haven't thought about this phenomenon yet. The sun must move parallel to the equator and move between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Its plane of Earth's revolution cannot be tilted at an angle to the plane of the equator because it would be perpendicular to the equator at only one point. It would be the same for both tropes."
"@Henryk Krzemiński There is NOTHING wrong about the Heliocentric model, and ALL observations account for the fact that the model is valid. Unfortunately, it is YOU that is in possession of the wrong information, or you misunderstand the figures that are given by science."
"@Sailor Man The only solution in such a situation is to assume that the Earth remains stationary with the sun revolving around it. The solar orbit is tilted to the plane of the Earth's equator at an angle of 66.5 degrees. The sun also moves between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Thanks to this, the angle of the sun's rays on the Earth changes, which creates the seasons of the year. This solution comes from Ptolemy's Geocentric Theory. However, it fell under the blows of the Heliocentric Theory because it could not explain the motion of the planets in the sky. It turned out, however, that the Heliocentric Theory had an even bigger problem. It cannot explain the movement of the stars, the signs of the zodiac, and the number of rotations in relation to the Sun and the stars in the sky."
"@Henryk Krzemiński The sun is at the centre of the solar system, with all other celestial objects orbiting the sun - this is 100% FACT. So tell us all then, what does cause the changing seasons on planet earth, if it's not because of the earth's axial tilt and orbit around the sun?"
Nice info  i Born on equinox 😁
good explanation with visuals
I was wrong all along. I really thought that the earth would tilt back and forth. Thanks for explaining.
The earth's constant rotational tilt relative to the earth's orbital plane around the sun is what is taught in schools as to the reason why we have seasons. Did you miss this day at school when it was explained in your science class?
Thanks a lot... I learnt much
I wish I had YouTube when I was at school. I would of done a hell of a lot better than I did.
"I understand the earth’s tilt is responsible for its seasons. However, I cannot understand the apparent change in the direction of tilt, ie towards the sun in summer and against in winter.  I clearly am missing something here."
"@JudaismIslamUnited in dec-january, the earth is at its closest, however, its not such a big difference than to the aphelion.  North pole on this perhilion are tilted away from the sun, just like you said, away from heat source, colder. South pole in this time are tilted towards to the sun, therefore summer in the southern hemisphere.  The tilt makes a huge difference rather than the slight closer distance to the sun."
@Apple YT so moving closer to a heat source actually makes it colder ?
@JudaismIslamUnited thats true
@Apple YT yeah cuz moving away from a heat source makes it warmer.  And moving closer to a heat source makes it colder.  Logic yeah .?
"@JudaismIslamUnited the earth's tilt have an effect on seasons, we are at goldilocks zone. The distance doesn't matter to seasons, its the tilt."
I dont understand if this is how earth revolves around sun why we see static stars through out the year ?   It should be rotating
Do you understand now?
"Static stars throughout the year?!  There are no static stars in the universe, and every amateur astronomer or amateur star photographer know that for the fact."
They rotate around the Nothern & Southern Celestial poles throughout the night and precess about 1 degree per day throughout the year.. nothing static. who every told you this was misleading you.   Go to Stellarium .. and see how the sky changes throughout the night & year.
"Excellent  explanation,  what I still don't  get is that., if hearth  spins on it's on axel  and goes around the sun which is 109 times wider than earth this means that how heart by been tilted just 23.5 degrees is enough to create that difference on the seasons, specially all four seasons last a periods of 3monts  In other words a chicken  rostisserie gets cooked evenly  while spins and rotates around the flames even if you tilted 23.5 degrees and put it to spin on it's on axel.   Just thinking out of the box."
"@Masyaf you really like big #'s..  I also like how you try to marginalize the tilt by saying ""small tilt""   Really a 46 degree change in sun angle is small but a 3% change in distance is something to focus on?"
"@Masyaf  It make perfect sense when you realize that 3.1 million miles distance accounts for 3% of total distance to the Sun, while ""small tilt"" changes amount of sunlight dramatically."
Bro it’s a good question  It doesn’t make sense how a small tilt can negate 3.1 million miles distance…
think of it as the difference between how intense the sun feels during mid day than in the morning & evening hours.
"You are not thinking out of the box, but mixing apples and pears.  When you tilt light source at 23.5 degrees you can easily observe that the same amount of light spreads on much bigger area, an brightness of the lighted area decreases significantly."
This was a brilliant explanation.
"Thaks Youtube, and thanks Earth Rocks."
"I have a few  problems understanding,  You show the Earth in Perihlion in January closer to the Sun  than Aphelion July. Surely it would be hotter the closer you are to the Sun?,  Another problem is, If I shine my torch on the equator of my globe then it stays on the equator linebecause of its axis, unless I move the globe closer then it shines on the tropic of cancer. which makes the Sun even closer to the Earth which makes it  hotter in the (WINTER TIME). it makes no sense to me."
"@Jim Sars Do you understand now? Incidentally, do you not actually accept as fact what has been presented in this demonstration, and that something is wrong or has been left out? Maybe you've now realised that it's your own inability to grasp the concepts in this video that is the real problem here?"
"@Jim Sars I'm gonna put it simply for you baby brain. YES, it is closer to the sun in Northern Winter. But since the Northern Hemisphere is titled AWAY from the sun, it receives less energy and heat. The sun also lowers it's altitude in the sky, thus shorter days."
"@Jim Sars Seems you refuse to accept this guys explanation.  max5250 - 7 days ago Change in distance between Earth and Sun during the year is only 3%, while the change in area receiving equal amount of sun light, due to difference in angle of light in relation to the surface is more than 30%. Can you spot the difference between 3 and 30?!   Can you see the  difference? what more can we say.. If you don't get this.. then clearly you need to go back to school and learn some basic geometry, & science."
"@Entangled Mindcells I get what you say about the angles of the Sun, and you are right about the higher the Sun is overhead the nearer the Sun is. If I see a jet in the sky the sky when it comes above my head it is very close, and if I see it on the horizon(or near to the horizon) it is far away. for this reason no matter what science says the Sun is overhead in the Summer and near the horizon in the winter. How can science say it is closer to Earth in the Winter?. I present FACTS."
@Jim Sars ​ If you understood even a fraction of science you would understand how ridiculous Flat earth and Fake space claims are.. but then again.. you go for the adhom attack because I presented FACT's and you presented incredulity.   Bravo.
Nice
Nice  👍

"Does the perihelion mean that southern hemisphere summers are hotter, northern hemisphere winters warmer than the opposite in July?"
"That would seem likely. However, the % of each hemisphere covered by land vs water might have a bigger impact. Oceans hold onto heat tightly and keep land cool in summer and warm in winter. There's more ocean in the Southern Hemisphere."
"Thank you so much, it helped a lot :)"
Aren't we corkscrewing through space
If you mean that vid FE's like to tout.  The speed and scale are widely exagerated. If it was more realistic.. it would be almost impossible to discern any any movements of the planets as it head in what looks like a constant speed.
"If the Earth is spinning and revolves plus the stars are moving as well , how come you see the same stars in the same direction every night I have proof of this  and another thing how come you see the sun and the moon at the same time 🤔🤨 I need answers"
@mal mal tell me anything related to firmament or any celestial objects or bodies without referring to the bible
"@Akario  Who said I was losing , the thing is when you trying to tell ppl things when they are so lost they can't be found then what's the point . JUST ALWAYS KNOW THIS GOD SAID HIS WORDS NEVER CHANGE if you don't remember anything PLEASE remember that"
��
I have question please someone help me to answer.  Why does the Amount of light received change with the seasons.
"Because orientation of Earth changes (due to change in orientation of axial tilt), and same amount of energy spreads on larger area."
If the earth is doing a full rotation every 24 hrs doesn't the mean we should all experience the same season at some part of the day? I'm dumb please explain
"Nope. Orientation of axial tilt changes during entire orbit, not during the day."
nice !
Its so fantastic. Learned a lot from the video. The animation/graphics part is amazing.
"Gostei, mas só vou colocar ""jonhia"" depois de legendado  (br). O vídeo é quase perfeito,depois de legendado vai ficar VALIOSO."
Super I'm loving your explaination
Nyc explanation
the earth had two moons
Please stop pushing the globe model cause it's causing me great fits of anger and making me wish you did not exist.
"@Ambient Occulus you questioned globe earth hardly, yet not the flat earth?"
@Ambient Occulus 0.0069 rpm is fast you say?😂
"@Ambient Occulus Really.. How hard have you really questioned the flat earth.  You realize you have to think it is  possible for two people thousands of miles apart looking off in opposite directions from each other, can see the same stars at the exact same moment even though they are looking in opposite directions..   Or Every observation of the sun, moon & stars contradict the flat earth and are exactly what is expected in the Globe model.   ""cause a globe is improbable.""  That my friend is call incredulity. ""I don't understand and think its not possible"" is your whole argument."
"@Entangled Mindcells I remember when I was 7 years old and school told me we were spinning on a ball. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now. You need to check yourself, cause a globe is improbable. Wake up, friend."
That’s why the religions are different & the calendars. It’s all based on the location in our solar system.

My geography lesson was not as detailed
Is this the weather changes asper American region only ?
"No weather is discussed in this video -- just seasons, and no it's not just America!"
I am a Sri Lankan. I can understand easily this lesson. Thank you
You are welcome
A tradução do áudio é quase que obrigatória. Só assim vou dizer que o vídeo é muito bom.
"I was thinking oh that's why it's called Christmas in July, because that's when Santa is out Sun Bathing! Oh and why is the equator tilted just because earth is ?"
"Yes -- the axis is the one around which the earth rotates. The equator is defined as the portion of the Earth that rotates around the dead center of the axis. So the equator, by definition, will tilt with the axis."
Pl make it little more clear
Great video.  Could have added axial precession as a quick detail.
Earth's rotation really makes my day.
literally
Ha! Me too. :)
"Thanks, this was very helpful ❤️🙏"
You’re welcome 😊
"Your amazing! I was having trouble with this topic, and in a mere 5 minutes, you explained it wonderfully! Thank you"
"@fa al Good quesrion! Its not about the distance from the sun (though that does slightly affect the severity of the seasons) but rather about how much sunlight is actually hitting an area at a given time. The distance does lightly affect the temperature. This would mean that the Southern hemispheres summers would be much hotter than the Northern. However, because the Southern Hemisphere is mainly water, it takes more heat to raise its temperature so the difference on average is negligible."
@Earth Rocks! howcome the earths tilt has  more significant effect  than the distance of 5 millions km differences between the sun the and earth for seasonal changes?
I'm so glad! Thanks for letting me know. :)
I learned this in 9th grade. Where you go to school. Dumb ass high..   🤣🤣🤣

"its because that girl rotates with sun in a vortex direction and at there relatives speedframe of reference, all planets drags by weight of sun in all even the sun having 98% of weight it rotates itself so creating centrifugal drag force for the grain size planets for him hence the rounds creating local gravity for themselves based on there individual mass. that's why all planets have different gravity.   https://youtu.be/0jHsq36_NTU https://youtu.be/C4V-ooITrws  enjoy blowing up the mind"
"Very informative Vedo to understand the phenomenon of day and night, and change of seasons."
"But,here on iceland we have 24h of sun in june but its not total darkness in december,we have 5 hours of day"
"There is a big difference between 24 hours of daylight and 24 hours of Sun. Iceland is not inside arctic circle, therefore Sun still sets and rise, even during the days when there is 24 hours of daylight."
By far the best video on this topic.  Having the circle on the Earth showing the most intense sun helped wrap my head around things.
Brilliant Explanation. Thanks!
I like the sound of the narrator's voice and her ability to explain.
Now if the earth didn’t have that tilt there wouldn’t be life in it. But sure aha 😤 god doesn’t exist ok.
So that's why some places have sunlight for 24 hrs. Thanks!
Astronomy & astrophotography in India.  https://youtu.be/8z12QMsGMMM
The illustration is what i was wondering about i already knew about the opposite seasons on each hemisphere. im a visual learner 😎 thank you!
"I love this very informative video. Here's my comment as follows. During Summer Solstice in June, the Earth is farthest (not ""furthest"" or ""further"" when you talk about physical distance, the root word is ""far"") away from the Sun. The Earth is approximately 152 million kilometers or 94.5 million miles away during Aphelion, while during Perihelion it is approximately 147 million kilometers or 91.4 million miles away. The Earth is ""farther"" by 5 million kilometers during Aphelion. When it comes to direct hit from the Sun's light, i.e. when the Sun is directly overheard, it is not the Equator that experiences nearest distance towards the Sun's rays. Due to the 23.43 degree tilt of the earth, areas along the Tropic of Capricorn experience the Sun directly overhead at the strike of 12:00 PM during December solstice. Examples of areas near the Tropic of Capricorn are Sao Paulo in Brazil, Formosa in Argentina, and Queensland in Australia. In contrast during June solstice, areas along the Tropic of Cancer experience the Sun directly overhead. Examples of areas near the Tropic of Cancer are Gulf of Mexico, Baja California Sur, Abu Dhabi in the Red Sea, Muscat Oman, and Hujing Island in Taiwan."
"I think she said the Sun was over head the equator at the equinox at 12. She also said the Sun was overhead the two tropics on the solstice, at 12. She got it right."
why is it always hot in afrika and in deserts?
"I am not sure exactly, but in general, too much sunshine makes a desert. I have noticed lots of the deserts are located in between tropic bands, with exception of the colder deserts in the mountain ranges rain shadows. Africa is a very large continent, so any winds blowing with moisture from the ocean towards the land would become drier over time. Interesting question. It is 10 mln square km of land that is not well utilized because of the hash climate."
"if every 24h earth faces the same direction, why doesn’t time completely change every six months? let’s say in January NY is facing the sun at 12pm… after 6 months, earth would be on the other side of the sun, so it should be night in NY, right??"
"Earth rotates around its own axis once every 23 hours and 56 minutes. It take another 4 minutes to face Sun again. So 24 hours/day keeps us always returning to facing the Sun. Multiply 4 minutes by 1/2 a year and you get 730 minutes or about 12 hours. By the time we get to the other side, we are 12 hours rotated from where we were on the other side. I hope this makes sense. I didn't include it in this version of the video to keep things simple."
��😫🙂😢🧢🤬🥪😢😐🇾🇪🇾🇪😐👋💯🥪😢
"Many people here in the Northern Hemisphere still believe we have summer because the earth is closer to the sun, and winter because the earth is further. Some years ago my school age daughter was taught this misconception by a dingbat teacher."
"What do they think in the southern hemisphere? ;) There are tons of misconceptions, as average Joe and Karen are not scientifically literate ;)"
��the more you know🌟
If the earth rotates than if in June at noon when one side faces the sun then in December the same side at the same time should not face the sun and at noon it should be dark there. How does it work?
"@Pure Strength  There are no delays. Solar day (24 hours) is the time it takes Earth to rotate approximately 361 degree around its axis, and by that time, the same place on Earth where it was noon previous day, will have noon today. Leap year day is added every 4 year (with some exceptions to maintain higher precision) because at the the end of one year (full orbit of the Earth around the Sun), the Earth is not at the same place in orbit where it started, but slightly behind (length of orbit that is 8 hours long when measured in hours). So, in 4 years Earth is entire day behind its position in orbit when it started 4 years ago. Therefore, leap day is added, so that the Earth is again aligned with its starting position."
@Earth Rocks! Then in a year we have 24 hours delay from standard 24 hour day time. And in 4 years it makes 4 days delay but we deduct 1 day only.
"The video simplifies the time of Earth's rotation to 24 hours. In fact, Earth rotates around its axis every 23 hours 56 minutes. It takes 24 hours to face the sun perfectly again. So a day is measured as how long it takes a single location to turn around once and face the Sun again (as it's orbiting the Sun). If you add up 4 minutes x 1/2 a year you get 12 hours, so 1/2 a year later, the same location that was facing the sun at noon in June will be on the opposite side facing the sun at noon in December. We just don't notice because we catch up every day."
The earth is portrayed as static.
"For simplicity sake, since its movement is not relevant for the explanation of season."
"It's crazy to know that if this gets fucked up a little bit, we are all dead.  very neat!"
"When I was in school, they wheeled in a tv with a vcr to show us black and white videos. Kids today are so lucky."
I had film projectors.
"Schools are horrible at explaining this. We get it's tilted, but Earth rotates and all 360° face the sun at some point during the day"
"@avfr : Ah, ok. Well it's always good to learn whenever you can."
@Kit Canyon I get it after watching this video but in schools I was never taught beyond tilt = seasons
@avfr : Did not grasp the content of this video? If you have more sun consistently over an area that will be warmer.
@Kit Canyon yes but that doesn't really explain why the tilt causes seasons
Of course. Who doesn't teach those facts?
Nice
great explanation love from india
"But i don't  understand  one thing , in december Indian dtate kashmir snowfall season and below 0 -degree and in mumbai india there weather almodt 25 to 30 degree, how?"
"btw, name of this channel.. Rocks!"
I guess sometime decades ago they took the sun and earth globe out of science classes! We learned this by fourth or fifth grade in the 70s. Nothing against those of you just now getting this because of this video but WTF? Are they really not teaching this in schools anymore? Guess they threw this out with the history books.

Nope.
So Eqautors have two summers
"Equatorial region generally doesn't have classical seasons, same as poles."
"Every so often, I get to realize that there are still a handful of people on earth that actually know how to explain something and get it exactly right."
Thank you.
This is actually the only video on youtube that explains seasons clearly! Thank you.
"I learnt in elementary school about 20 years ago we get winter because the planet is further away from the sun, and the teacher never said there was winter down south once summer over here. I'm so mad about all the BS we learnt. At this point in age I know of course earth is tilted, n all that because we get that midnight sun over here + I'm book smart enough to call BS on my childhood education. Just wanted to check out the demonstration video as we just talked about this topic at dinner. Vsauce has a very nice video about how earth and the sun moves together in space. Worth a watch for sure if anyone's interested in the subject."
*****
"If earth is tilted, everyday there should be season.. Coz once the Earth face sun for example USA is lower position but when it is not facing it much higher position..."
Your fellow human beings call the daily seasons day and night ;)
This is the best explanation yet !!      Thank You!!
It's 365 days and 6hrs time taken by earth to complete one rotation to the earth
So a few degrees tilt (thousands of mile) means the sun shine is hotter in North America than when we are 3 million miles closer? Sun Rays hit parallel right?
"A few million miles in a vacuum don't matter apparently. The strength of the Sun could be calculated with the inverse square law at the distance +3 mln miles (1% difference?). On the other hand, the temperate climatic zone provides about half the solar energy to solar panels one can get at the equator."
Thank..you.. for making this video it helped me focused on my....school
Thank you sir or madam ❤️ nicely explained 🙂
"None of my school teacher never taught or explain me about how earth rotate the sun like this video did ... It's been 12 years of my school life and I got to understand about this only today ... Wish I could learn all these things ,be a teacher and teach primary students"

The best season is salt  Dont even try me lads
I am not even salty! ;)
"Thanks but Im still confused wherever I stand I still see the earth turn CLOCKWISE in relation to the sun, how come!"
@max5250 Thank you so much I finally figured it out
"When observed from above the Southern pole, Earth turns clockwise in relation to the Sun, and when observed from above North pole, Earth turns counter clockwise in relation to the Sun."
We learn
Imagine we take a bear every 6 months to cooler place. Then he would be hibernating for whole life ;)
Waaw..what a excellent explaining 👌 👏

"Jesus' pop was the creator, bro."
"Question for anyone here. I honestly don’t know this. If my coordinates were X and Y in the spring, do they change when the earth tilts back in the fall?"
Latitude and longitude never change no matter what time of year it is. Those coordinates are all considered fixed positions. The light may move around but the terrain does not.
this model is flawed...
@Pavel Read above please 🙈
Yeah that's something good.
"Learned about this in school, fascinating!!"
Why is it called tropics of cancer and Capricorn
If the earth rotates around sun the why if the earth is on one side of sun the go on other side day don't turn night and night don't turn day
"Day and night happen due to rotation of Earth around its axis, not because its orbit around the Sun."
Can you make a video about fullmoon and moon eclipse.
Exllent
Your upsetting the flat earthers hahahahahaha
Excellent presentation! Thx
Amazing explanation . Thank you so much ✨✨
Wrong right out the gate 23 hrs 56 mins 24 hrs is what's relative to the sun.
@Earth Rocks! I am sorry I did that it was such a bad move for me to say that I knew what meant and my behavior was bad I apologize to you Earth Rocks.
"You are correct that I simplified the information to 24 hours. 23 hrs and 56 minutes rotation + 4 minutes more rotation to face Sun again -- thus a ""day"" on Earth."

Thanks 😊
Earth rotates every 23 hours 56 minutes. It takes 24 hours to face the sun perfectly again.
"1) By reflecting away 30% of ISR the albedo, which would not exist w/o the atmosphere/GHGs, makes the earth cooler than it would be without that atmosphere like that reflective panel set behind the windshield. Remove the atmosphere/GHGs and the earth would become much like the Moon and Mercury, a barren rock with a 0.1 albedo, 20% more kJ/h, hot^3 on the lit side, cold^3 on the dark. Nikolov, Kramm (U of AK) and UCLA Diviner mission all tacitly agree. "

I'm 24 years old and since my childhood everyone told me that earth's revolution around the sun causes seasons but noone could explain it to me coz none of them knew about the earth's tilt.. Idk what I thought before searching for this today and after 24 years I'm pleased to know the answer 🤣🤣🤣
Yay! :)
0:15 the stars are rotating together with Earth. Really?
The 736 ''thumbs down'' are the ''earth is flat Trumpanzees''....wow !
https://youtu.be/0ZZb_hJqoW4
god bless you
At last a video with clear detailed explanation that's only 5 min long.
Explanation Very good indeed..🌍🌍
SUMMER WINTER
equinox 23 SEPTEMBER
365 - DAY ONE YEAR
Dislikes are From peaceful community 🤡
Simply explained and very informative!
Seeing in lockdown..
Good
��🔥
this video is so helpful
Cool
When did you guys study this at your school?  At what grade?   In my country we have learnet it at high school  lol
"This was amazing, especially the 3d example of the earth"
thanks for your clarification
Remember vividly my 1st grade teacher tought me that the earth move pass the floating cloud so we got rainy season. 😆😂😁
It has helped me that I am a week in geography but it makes me understand the whole chapter
How do flat earthers explain the seasons lol
Good job thank u 👏
When sun is closer should be summer season in india  which is between may- june
@max5250 yes you r right
"Nope, distance from Sun doesn't affect seasons as considerably as angle of Earth surface in relation to the Sun."
I also think that distance from the sun cause seasons lol😂
@janho Gupta Then why mention anything about the sun's distance as a cause of the seasons?
@Sailor Man bro yeah i already got that
"Actually, the change in distance to the sun has virtually no effect on the earth's seasons. It's the earth's tilt that accounts for why each hemisphere experiences winter, spring, summer and autumn."
"nicely explained,  and the quiz, at the end,  gives the confidence that I have learned right and well, thanks!!"
Beautiful educative video no doubt about that .
Some people teach well. Better than others. Excellent video. Very well explained. A must see!
Glad it was helpful!
"None of this explains why Sept 22, and the Autumn generally is warmer in the Northern hemisphere than March 22nd, and the Spring. But they get the same sunlight? Does it have to do with the fact that the oceans have had 6 months of warming so Fall is warmer, and 6 months of cooling so Spring is colder? (Since the ocean is probably a better store of heat than the land)."
"Yep! The warmest and coolest days of the year don't correspond with the highest and lowest sunlight, but how long that sunlight has been being absorbed by water and land, so they come a month or two after, depending on the land/ocean makeup of a given area."
you got it
"I simply can't thank you enough for this video, you sure are talented. The fact that you can explain all this (EASILY) within 5 1/2 minutes. Again, thank you. I was struggling with a school project and this really eased the stress I was in. Such a simple explanation on a big topic. It really helped."
So glad it helped you. Lovely compliment. Thanks for passing it along. :)
Like from Indian occupied Kashmir.....👍
Plz hindi
June 21 not june 22 🌞🏖️summer solstice
@Sailor Man Thanks for the correction.
"@max5250 Actually, in the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice can vary between the 20th and the 22nd of June. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice"
Summer solstice varies between 20th and 21st.
"I use this in my lecture, excellent"
awesome
No flat earther here.
Excellent explanation!!!
I think 365 and 1/2 days to complete one year ok????
Super Explanation.. Co-incidence s my Date-of-birth s 23rd of September yaar 🤗
any one gotta watch this in school

cocaine is a helluva drug
Now I correctly understand the summer and wintertime at my place.  Perfect explanation for confused people like me.
Glad it helped!
Waduh nikmat barsah di dunia bikin gw mabok kepayang. Naik pewat di ketinggian beberapa kilo meter aja.  Bumi pun tak nampak ada penghuninya.
Great illustration and explanation katryn!!
Earth is further away from the sun when it’s the hottest. It still doesn’t make sense
"@TSH ACE Do you understand now, why each hemisphere experiences hotter and colder temperatures according to the tilt of the planet, or do you still not understand what was explained in this video?"
@max5250 yea
"@TSH ACE  ""Earth is further away from the sun when it’s the hottest."" Not really, since summer in southern hemisphere (when Earth is closest to the Sun) is hotter than summer in northern hemisphere (when Earth is farthest from the Sun), and consequently, winter in northern hemisphere (when Earth is closest to the Sun) is milder than the winter in southern hemisphere (when Earth is farthest from the Sun).  ""how many miles difference from the sun in winter and summer? I think like 1 million or so"" Difference is 3 million miles, or 3% of total distance to the Sun.  "" The distance of the tilted earth is maybe Idno 10 thousand miles?"" Distance of tilted surface of Earth is irrelevant, since angle of surface of Earth is key factor there."
@Earth Rocks! how many miles difference from the sun in winter and summer? I think like 1 million or so. The distance of the tilted earth is maybe Idno 10 thousand miles?
Exactly! Clearly how close and far the Earth as a whole is to the Sun is not related to seasons. It's whether we're tilted towards or away.
Very good example
En la ilustracion la tierra gira con todo  y las estrellas 😅
Same constellations all year around and the properties of matter debunk you
@SpottedSharks yeh I only deal with scientific method not dogma bro
@Major Hazzard Enjoy your career in Not Astronomy.
"@SpottedSharks shooting up ""from"" the horizon.... Seriously try harder mate"
"@Major Hazzard if you see a shooting star approaching from the horizon, then it's the end of your world."
"@Major Hazzard : What? LOL. So I can see it during the winter months clearly about 45deg elevation but not other times? Why is that? By your claim it would seem that Orion is moving out of my vision. How can this be? Are the heavens tilting?  So what is your ""model"" of the stars over flat earth anyway? Are they just lights on the magical dome? Something else? What makes then move during the night? Why aren't the stars always in the same position every night at the same time (except for Polaris)?   So many questions and I'm guessing your only answers will be to either run away or claim ""perspective"", as if perspective isn't based on real world sizes, distances and points of view."
Thanks
It's simply videos like this that make a round planet more understood.
ummmm sooo boing
your here because your teacher made you  it's ok
Wish we had access to youtube during our school days
I use Adolph's on just about everything.
"Ngga bisa bahasa Inggris "" tapi tetap memahami lah ya"""
�� in Pakistan 🇵🇰  June is more warmer than January
Of course. The northern hemisphere experiences its summer at the opposite time of the year as the southern hemisphere.
"Hi madam I had one question, why we could not fall from earth when we are on pole of earth"
Gravity! :)
its littly good
online skewl
I'm 17 and I never learned this in school
I hate Summers 😠😠😠😠💥💥💥🥵🥵🥵
my science teacher put this up on google classroom but likee we could learn alot without school lol
same
You are wrong earth takes 23hr and 56 min around rotation
23h 56 min and 4.1 sec   0.00069444 RPM
My teacher told me to watch this video :)
one of the best videos
thing I did not know
I'm lost. It's just day and night as far as I am concerned.
Thank you 💕
Summer in Australia is awful (if you have no aircon..(can't escape the heat)
This was set by my teachers congrats
God of this world make everything oposite! And people believe!
"@1:11, is that the other way? Closer in July and Farther in January?"
First season is winter or spring and the second one is spring then summertime and then fall.
ikr!!! ;D
What can flatearthers say about this? Come on guy!!! 🤣
"Then go to the channel DITRH & find out!   Flat earth society is dis info propaganda... no actual ""flat earthers"" would or do have anything to do with that organization.   (Don't kill the messenger, I'm simply stating what so called true ""flat earthers"" say)  Anywho,  make sure you have a Great day!"
"Look forward to hearing their replies, after all, the flat earth society has members ""all around the globe"" 😀"
It is said that the earth orbits the sun at approximately 66thousand miles an hour how do all the sattalites keep up with it I am puzzled by this
GRAVITY!!!!
"They don't have to ""keep up"" since gravity takes care of it."
"I dont understand how the earth 25 degres angle axes will dictate the seasons yet we get 3 million miles closer to the sun during the winter...it doesnt make sense. BTW, not a flatearther"
"@Happy Rhino There is some reason why you're still unable to grasp the fact that it's the earth's tilt that causes the seasons? Very few people have an issue with understanding this, so I am wondering what your lack of comprehension is caused by? Are you not concerned about this failing you have?"
"@Happy Rhino In winter, is the sun lower in the sky and not providing as much heat to the earth's surface as it does during summer. Also, in summer, is the sun in the sky longer during the day than during the winter months? Can you actually not understand why these factors make it warmer when the Earth's tilt makes each hemisphere face the sun at a more direct angle and for a longer duration of time during the day? Is there some sort of blockage in your brain that is preventing you from understanding how the Earth's tilt causes the seasons in each hemisphere?"
@Sailor Man nope
Do you understand now Rhino?
Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
It requires 365.25 days to complete one rotation around sun.
Orbit around the sun.
So what happens when the direction of the angle changes?
"@apop- his  Change in precession cycle means that in a long run, seasons will gradually switch their places in year, so, eventually,  northern hemisphere winter will happen at June, while northern hemisphere summer will start at December. But, a that time, there will be no living being remembering summer in June, so that will be normal for them."
"@apop- his I see what you mean now. I guess over such a large period of time, adjustments will need to be made with regards to when certain events arise, ie winter and summer solstice."
@Sailor Man no you need to read the question. I'm talking about axis angle which on the video is north facing toward right and south to left. Precession cycle that lasts 26000 years then it'll be opposite. North facing toward left and south toward right.
"It's the change of direction of angle that accounts for why one hemisphere receives more light than the other at various times of the year, causing the seasons, lol.  Perhaps you need to watch the video again to get a fuller understanding?"
"Awesome, informative video!!! Thanks"
"Great video! Very useful information! Thank you very much, it helped me a lot!"
"You are wrong. IT IS 356,25 daily rotations, not 365."
@Sailor Man :)
"Actually, I think what you meant to say, was '366.25' daily rotations per year, as stated in the following link - ironic that you would start your comment with 'You are wrong.' lol.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation"
Why can't just say the earth dip below  the sun . instead of saying the earth tilt towards the sun
"@owen ferguson I'm not sure where you think any confusion was created by what was said and shown in the video? It was clearly stated that the earth has a tilt of 23.5 degree with regards to the plane of rotation with the sun.  It was never stated that this angle ever changes, so therefore, the angle is obviously permanent."
@Sailor Man I now know that the tilt is permanent it doesn't tilt to give the season  That's where the confusion comes in  Should make it more clearer  By watching other videos animation it becomes clear just saying it tilt regarding the season  can be confusing  Use to think the earth goes above then below the equator of the sun to give the season. Not by tilting. So I get it now
Why do you have an issue with the use of the word 'tilt'? The earth's axis is on a tilt of 23.5 degrees. It wouldn't be correct to say it has a 'dip' of 23.5 degrees.

NASA animations
Here 4 school
The one who watch this vid will beome a milloinare one day.Try this guys😄😄https://youtu.be/E_rogojtfzU
Helpful! ^_^
"Great video, congratulations!!!"
How can both side of earth peoples(night and day side) can see moon but can't see  sun pls someone understand me🙏
"Earth revolves around the Sun, while Moon revolves around Earth, so positions of the Sun and Moon on our sky are not dependant in any way. Two observers on the opposite side of the Earth, one on the side where it is noon, while other on the side where it is midnight, will see the Moon at ""First Quarter"" or ""Third Quarter"" (one half of the Moon lit) if Sun, Earth and Moon positions form right triangle."
"very important for PMS/CSS, watch,share and SUBSCRIBE  https://youtu.be/oFdHOFjkcLo"
Thanks and it's more helpful ☺️
Thanks a Million
anyone here from school
Online class?no problem we have this..🙂
I’m here because of modules.😃
Hlo
Welcome to ppl who came her for school
America can't put a price on everything in the universe.
Sure we can... name something and this American Will put a price on it! 😝😝😝
I'm 38 and the surprise quiz at the end still gave me anxiety.
This is so so helpful. Thank you so much!
Glad it was helpful!
so crazy broooooooo its so good
people who had to watch this for Mr. Huyhn ------->
@Dakota Dickerson OMG HI bahaha
Dis too hard for a 9 year old like me
Why did you say 'Dis'?
That was the first time i truly understand that. Thank you for sharing
You are so welcome
"This is for 6 the standard ,we can easily revise  by this  thank u for a good explanation"
I still don't get it.
Do you get it yet?
This is great information but this presentation is about as interesting as a wet blanket.
This video really solved all my doubts and diagrams helped me for easy understanding
Thankyou very much Mam....☺☺
I learned this in first grade.
Why us everyone look moon in the left side (when our look is in the west in summer) and we look moon in the right in another 15 days.if the earths 1 rotation is 24 hour i didnt know how much moon rotatet  around earth in the same hours. If a asked if the sun rotatet have of you anyone too teach me that i am wrong.thanks God guide us hopefull
"This video doesn't get into the moons and their phases, but another video does. I recommend looking at this one to find the answers to your questions: Tidal Causes: https://youtu.be/eMX--80J_5o"
"The earths rotation causes the moon to move from east to west in the sky, and the moons orbit causes it to have a much slower west to east motion relative to the stars in the background."
Isn't it 365 1/4 days?
@Earth Rocks! ok👌 . Thanks!
"Yes, you are correct. To create a video like this one, some concepts get simplified, which helps some and confuses others!"
��😂😂😀
1.ans is b 2.ans is a 3.ans is d 4.ans is d
Very good👍
Good 🤗
Nice lesson for children🤔
I LIKE IT
"Omg thank you so much, this was very helpful"
Very well explained using the graphics animation! It only mow I understood  this so clearly. There are also two other movements of the earth. The tilt of the earth varies from about 22 degrees to 24 degrees and it happens over a period of about 46000 years. The axis also rotates around with the centre of the earth as a pinned point on the axis and the movement of the north pole(and south pole) forming a circle. The north pole points to different polestars during this rotation and takes about 22000 years to complete one rotation. Hope you will show this in another video..
This is science school
My eyebrows are soft lol
Lol she moves the earth with her mouse
I bet one of my friends watching this video for school work will see this
"From the comments below, what were the younger generations taught at school, this was taught at basic social studies in grade 5. Maybe schools should teach basic knowledge before they start on prefrence genders."
"Hey Earth Rocks, this is a weird request, but would you mind if I sample some of this information to have it in my music? cheers"
go ahead :)
"I will never understand this... I totally understand the tilt of earth, just don't understand how the earth receives more or less sunlight, it is still spinning the same, I always thought the sun spun like a top that is just about to fall over...."
"I could follow the explanation, and understand completely how the northern hemisphere receives less light in winter, whilst the southern hemisphere receives more light, making it their summer. Perhaps you need to watch the video again, and you'll 'get it' this time around?"
Why can't they teach this in school
Like si lo ves por las clases en línea
Thanks a lot..it was really helpful.
Who is in physics learning nothing but your teacher sets you alot of work and you cant get it down
Anyone else here from online school?
Nope
Yep
Very nice video
Learnt Soooo much thhx
Good Morning Mam.😊 Ans are:- 1- 12 2- 24 hours 3-Fall 4-Tropic of capricorn

Me too kid
Thanks
Boring
Thanks for this amazing explanation.
I can almost guarantee this is taught in a skit by seth macfarlane lol
it is wrong it takes365.25 days that is why we have a leap year
Thank you Hermes for giving us the four seasons

@Earth Rocks! You are incredibal!😊🤍✨
@Earth Rocks! Thank you
@Fortapistone You can see the amount of sunlight and darkness at all Earth location throughout the year on world daylight clocks. Here's a good example: https://in-the-sky.org/twilightmap.php . I hope that helps.
@Earth Rocks! yo
I thought it was 8 hours of night!!!!
It? The hours of night (darkness) depends on the latitude where you live and the time of year. You will experience exactly 8 hours of darkness at likely four times during a given year (depending on where you live). You can test this yourself by marking sunset and sunrise in your location throughout the year.

The cause of the huge temperature swings during an entire year...  Solar intensity: I = Io sin a Io = 1000 W/m^2 (Max intensity - this is how much sunlight you get during a Lahaina Noon) a = Sun's altitude  Half as much sunlight = half as much heat = you'll more likely to get snow❄️🌨️

shouldn't Antarctica melt in south's summer?
"Even though Antarctica receives sun in the southern hemisphere summer, the acute angle of the sun means that there is very little warming energy in it, certainly not enough to cause all of the continent's ice to melt. However, some of the ice does melt, but it returns again in winter, and so the cycle continues. Understand now?"
"Why? It will only melt if the temperature warms above the freezing point of ice for long enough to melt the massively thick layers. The average summer temperature is still below freezing. In winter, well well below freezing. The currents and ocean that surround Antarctica keep it insulated from warm currents coming from the equator and make it much more difficult to warm Antarctica than the Arctic."
Nope.
if the earth is rotating once per day? why isn't day and night allways the same amount of time?
"Paul Arbuckle  Because Earth’s rotational axis is tilted. Therefore, and night duration is the same only at equator, and changes on other latitudes."
Thanks🙏
Earth roll own axis this true or not please explain
"Earth roll own axis this true or not please explain
  Axis of rotation of Earth is not 'rolling' during the orbit, but stays in the same orientation (in relation to the background stars). It does eventually change, but in terms of thousands of years."
? I don't understand the question.
The Earth is not turning? Did you notice the the earth stay on one side and it seems like not turning the earth go one side to same side on other side does this make sense. The Earth should be turning and showing all side to the sun. It just stay on one tilted side.
"The Earth rotates once every 24 hours, providing light and dark to most places on the planet every day. However, the tilted axis maintains its same orientation over many years. That's what creates the season."
I didn’t even know the earth tilts wtf
@22 Sealed  Dude... It's Plane not Plain. (Even small little things like that are used as ammunition against the plane-t earth. Just fyi...)
"intelligence wisdom And, you know everything about lying...  LOL"
It doesn't. It's a plain not a sphere. This is fake scientism.
"The Earth doesn't tilt, it is tilted always in the same direction, tilt is not changing (during short period like couple hundred years) but stays the same. What changes is the orientation of the tilt, since Earth moves in circle during its orbit."
amazing explanation thank you so much.

Now I am happy thank you much
There are people that can't understand something so simple.
I answered all correctly
Great video. Used it today homeschooling the kids. They were wondering why it is spring in November in Australia where we are traveling while it is Fall back home in Nevada.
WRITTEN ACTIVITY NEXT WEEK. THIS ONE IS REAL HELPFUL
"1:07 Aphelion is farther, not further. Farther refers to distance; further never refers to distance."
Nice explanation
Upto 1:20 sec. Question? Why antartica colder then north pole? :) it is flat?
@Djabrail NTP The Sun is approx. 1' smaller in July than it is in January.
"@Earth Rocks! earth is supposadly 3million miles closer to the sun during antartic summer, does it address that too?"
"Do a search on the comments, and you'll find that same question answered below. :)"
Thank you. My son understands season's much better.. Thank you.
Brilliant visual aid for somebody like myself with poor concentration. Now I understand it completely. Well done!
This is my go to video for quick revision of earth sun cosmic interactions.
How can an axis of a spinning object be tilted with no restraint at either end? What happens to a spinning gyro when it’s tilted axes is free to move?
I am confusion
"@Kit Canyon  There is no use talking to him, he is a complete fruitcake. He confuses gyroscopes with spinning tops, he claim to know about inertial guidance systems but, when the video showing gyroscope spinning while tilted is presented to him, he behave like there is nothing there... I guess he was never playing with ball as kid, because he would knew that we can spin the ball at an angle, and throw it in the air, and the ball will continue to spin at an angle, until it touch the ground."
Kit Canyon are you going to answer my question?
Kit Canyon I simply asked a question. What’s your answer?
"@Kit Canyon after all your comments to my posts you say that I'm ""just being a troll."" You came to me, I did not go find you somewhere. Trolling is another word that you don't seem to understand. People that would read this series of comments will see who is who and what is what.   This is my original comment. ""How can an axis of a spinning object be tilted with no restraint at either end? What happens to a spinning gyro when it’s tilted axes is free to move?"" This is a question and the replies should be in answer to it. You and max5250 posted volumes of comments without a single answer, so who are the ""trolls""?"
Very good educational video.
can someone explain why here in melbourne we get 4 seasons in one day..
"Omg I love you, some article and videos are not descriptive at all! Great video! This actually help me understand what exactly is going on."
im living in equator . i dont experience seasons change.

"I always tbought tbe seasons where caused by the distance we were from the sun, then i realised that can't be it as it the opposite hemisphere which was the same distance from the sun was in the opposite season. So now I know its merely to do with tilt of the earth, i wonder why it isn't warmer and colder the closer and further we are from the sun, given the extremes of our elipitical orbit and how much difference a 23° can make why isn't it making a difference?   Are the temperatures within the seasons caused by air temperatures from the poles being moved around the hemispheres?"
'Extremes of our elliptical orbit'? Our orbit around the sun is only 3 percent away from being a perfect circle - there is actually very little eccentricity to it.
Temperatures do change due to the variation in distance of Earth from the Sun but these differences do not influence temperatures as much as angle of Earth rotational axis.
Thank you!
Nice videos dude 💦🔥🥰😜
Send TV my big brain knowledge is increasing on the knowledge of the earths rotation and seasons.
"Bruh I learnt so much from this, keep it up my guy :D"
its a girl doe...
Great video man
"Yeah my knowledge in my big brain is increasing, I wonder if the Minecraft earth has the same rotations"
You learn more in YouTube than in school
Took it too far
Absolutely 🤗
You pay more attention to videos you click on than you do in class. If you have 20 kids not listening to a teacher no one is gonna learn anything even if the teacher wants to teach.
Yep
And lol
Thankyou so much..
"The animation and diagrams are actually wrong but, it gets the point across. In fact most of the diagrams in textbooks and animations on the web in for this are wrong. It's like they've all copied the same mistake over and over as nauseam."
We're all wondering why you didn't mention what the issue is with the 'animation and diagrams'? Surely you would have been only too eager to point out the 'mistake'?
"Could you elaborate the mistake, please?"
Would be more helpful if you could describe the mistakes. :)
Excellent visual guide! Crystal clear explanation! Thank you.
good info
Why don't we adjust for the 12 hr difference there should be from summer to winter
"As you'll see in comments below (better than I explained!): ""The Earth takes only 23 hours and 56 minutes to spin around once on its axis. The reason there are 24 hours in a day is that it takes another four minutes of spin to account for the Earth's orbit around the sun."" Collectively this keeps solar noon at same place relative to Sun-Earth line throughout year. 4 minutes x 1/2 of 365 days = 730 minutes = 12.2 hrs. :)"
cool little vid make more plz
Thanks make more videos
Is the day at the equator longer compared to further up north or south of the poles. Because the circumference of the Earth is shorter so it should be spinning faster than at the equator which takes longer time ? Does it makes sense?  I can't wait for the earth to tilt back 🥵 it's 2-3° above average this summer
"@Bha Ratha   Sorry, but you missed it again. Earth is not rotating slower or faster, Earth rotates always at the same speed, but since it is a sphere, ground at the equator will move faster then the ground toward the poles. Regarding your analogy with race track, runner on the outside lane, and runner on the inner lane are completing one circle in the same amount of time (same rate of Earth rotation), but since the outer lane is much longer then the inner one, runner in the outer line have to run much faster to complete one circle at the same time when the runner in the inner lane completes it (speed of ground movement at different latitudes).  Also, Earth doesn't change it's tilt, only the orientation of the axis, in relation to the Sun, changes, due to the fact that Earth axis tilt is fixed in relation to the Space, but orbital path is circular."
@max5250 That completely boggled my mind.. I imagined it like a Running track the runner on the inside lane has a shorter distance than the one at the outer lane so the reason why runners start the race with intervals of certain distance from each other. Ok now I understand but can't imagine the earth rotates slower as we head up the North Pole. I wonder based on theory of relativity does the slow pace of the mean time is experienced faster?
"The latitudes cover shorter overall distance as you head north, but the same rotational speed (once per ~24 hrs). The north doesn't spin faster than the equator or the south. They all spin at same rate (once per day), but the overall distance traveled in that day is most at equator, least at poles. Less distance but same overall time! So one day is same length ~24 hrs. Sunlight vs darkness will vary with seasons, but overall day length is same."
"Does it makes sense? No, it doesn't make any sense.   The length of a day (day/night period) is always 24 hours, because it depends on the rate of rotation of Earth (24 hours from noon to noon).   Different length of circumference of Earth, from equator to the poles, only means that the surface of Earth is moving at slower speed when going from equator to the poles."
Great explanation. I have been thinking that it is the orbit path that is tilted that causes the different seasons until I saw these videos..thanks!

"have a few simple questions for those who are so quick to say that we revolve around the sun.  If that's the case, then how do we see the same constellations and stars year-round? Summer we face one direction on one side of the sun right? And 6 months later we are on the opposite side of the sun, correct? Think about this critically, forget what you have been told, and just use common sense. Would we not see completely different stars as we are looking in the opposite direction on the back side of the sun? No disrespect to anyone intended, please explain this for us."
"But we do see different stars. Our north rotational pole is lined up almost exactly with Polaris, and as we rotate, we face different stars (and constellations) depending on the time of day. Of course we see them only at night when we're rotated away from the Sun; so during our winter we see a different set coming up along the horizon than we do during our summer. But we always see Polaris and the ones around Polaris, because they always stay directly above us in the northern hemisphere (it's the southern cross and others that the south pole points toward for the southern hemisphere). Remember, the poles point in the same direction no matter which part of the orbit we're in, but as you say, in summer we experience darkness during the other half of the rotation and see other stars on the horizon.

How do we know we are perfectly positioned on an Axis? Why cant we see the north pole with a satalite? Why not just show a live picture of Earth?
"How do we know we are perfectly positioned on an Axis?! ???!  Why cant we see the north pole with a satalite?"" We can see that of course, but not from all the satellites.  ""Why not just show a live picture of Earth?"" Google for Himawari 8"
"But then why are winters in the southern hemisphere warmer than winters in the northern hemisphere, considering that when it's winter in the southern hemisphere the earth is farther away from the sun?"
Because the southern hemisphere has more ocean than land
@Earth Rocks! Thank you!
"Winters in Antarctica are the coldest on the planet, aren't they? The actual temperature one experiences at any given time of the year is due to a combination of currents, winds, atmospheric circulation, and albedo (reflectivity) and heat capacity of the ground (how much heat the ground absorbs and how readily it holds it and later releases it). Oceans are an incredible moderating influence because they store a lot of heat. They can cool hotter land in summer and warm cooler land in winters."
Does Antarctica has a 6 months sunlight as the North Pole has?? Can you give a proof for that please?
"@Earth Rocks! Right at the poles, it should be 6 months of each (sunrise and sunset are on the equinoxes), but as you head towards the equator, you'll start to see the sun rising and setting over different periods. At the Arctic/Antarctic circles on the solstice, there will be 24-hour daylight (or night)."
"Not 6 months of sunlight. North Pole doesn't have that either. Inside the Arctic and Antarctic circle, there are times of the year that they get 24 hours of sunlight or 24 hours of darkness. The times are opposite. When everything inside the Arctic Circle gets 24 hours of sunlight (June solstice), Antarctic Circle gets 24 hours of darkness. And vice versa at December solstice. Proof? Just go visit at those times of year and you'll see. I just returned from the oceans just north of the Antarctic Circle and experienced while there 3 hours of darkness and 21 hours of light. Just travel around at different times of the year, and you'll see."
The Earth takes only 23 hours and 56 minutes to spin around once on its axis. The reason there are 24 hours in a day is that it takes another four minutes of spin to account for the Earth's orbit around the sun.
And the Earths Tilt is 23.4 °
Correct! Thanks. :)

So if sun is closer to earth in January does that give Australia the hottest summer and Antartica the coldest winter?
*Antarctica
@Stats Careful with the spelling - Antarctica.
You must be mistaken Arctic and Antartica
"Hottest place on Earth isn't Australia, but coldest is Antarctica! More to do with wind and current systems though."
Why would you stick up for the globe? The earth has fans? Question everything.

Dude. You’re so cool. I was potty trained since I was 2 and half. We can be in the cool club together.
What’s odd is people living on the equator don’t have seasons and only learnt that when I arrived in Southern Asia.
"I also as far back as I can remember I've loved studying about this stuff, had the hardest time trying to teach my kids on how to look at it. They thought the Earth was closer to the sun during summer months and how they would be out in the back yard sometimes playing around bed time."
Something more to be explianed
"If the earth is slightly closer to the sun in January than it is in July, does that mean on average, summer in the southern hemisphere is slightly warmer than summer in the northern hemisphere? Vice versa, winter in the southern hemisphere should also be a bit colder than winter in the northern hemisphere."
No winters in the southern hemisphere is warmer than winters in the northern
Correct.
"So, that's why the temperature in Australia is around  30° C right now and today is January 8th 2019 and -6 -5 in my Country which is located in south Europe. Now I know how seasons are being made. This about Australia and my country, like this comment if I'm right, reply to this comment if I've got this wrong."

If this diagram is any where near accurate..how is it that we see the sun above us and not  tothe side...I'm just asking why
@max5250 ok i will try that ... Thsank you
"Because of our orientation when we stand on the Earth.  If you want to see the Sun from your side, lay down on the ground and position your body in North-East direction."
The earth is travelling  around the sun at a 1000 miles an hour.  It spins at 1000 miles an hour
"Allegedly earth is traveling at about 66,600 mph around the sun."
"No Karl, the earth is travelling around the sun much faster than 1000 miles an hour."
"There is no 24 hour sun in antarctica. Also, why is there only one hour difference with daylight savings? Shouldn't there be a 12 hour difference if the earth is on the other side of the sun? Look at that continent. 12 noon in the fall equinox is 12 midnight in the spring equinox."
"Hamster Lord Figure out why sidereal days and solar days are different, maybe then you can find the answers to your own questions"
"There is no 24 hour sun in antarctica.  Sure there is.  ""Also, why is there only one hour difference with daylight savings?""  It's no wonder you didn't get what is daylight savings for if you think there is no 24 hour sun in Antarctica."
Excellent explanation
Very good ! Excellent video. In this explanation it's very easy to understand.
"At 1:02 the correct word is ""Farther."""
"The coolest thing is high noon on the equator at an equinox, no shadows are visible."
The greatest factor in climate change... not fossil fuels... the earths tilt!
I live in Minnesota. I hate winter. Some day I will move to where I can ride my motorcycle 365 days a year. Love the video though. It's nice to refresh on the basics once in a while.
"I know this video is a fact. But check it out. On a hot day, you can feel the intense sun 93 MILLION MILES AWAY. Yet, I have to believe just because it tilts and we are MUCH CLOSER that now, I'm freezing my ass off!  If I stand at a 23 degree angle to my fireplace, does my face start to freeze?  Doesn't make sense. I KNOW I KNOW.."
"@مجودي 2019  He made a good point about the vacuum of space. Stand close to a fire, and you have the air transfer the heat to you, but in a vacuum, it's only the radiation. It's still just unbelievable that such a small tilt can bring freezing temperatures, even while the distance is extremely closer!"
"It isn't about the distance, it's about the angel that the sun rays hit the earth. Distance has absolutely nothing to do with the seasons."
"@max5250 OK.. Thank you. The ""not heating a vacuum"" makes more sense."
"Roger,   When you are standing next to fireplace, you fell the heat from the surrounding atmosphere heated by the fire. When you walk away from the fire you will feel cold,  no matter at what angle you are.  The heat from Sun can reach to Earth only through radiation, since vacuum cannot be heated up, and when you have same amount of radiation spread on bigger surface, amount of energy (per square meter) will be significantly smaller then when the same amount of radiation is spread on smaller surface (coming at 90°angle). Beside, during the summer, day are longer, and air, soil, and water accumulates more energy then during the winter.  You can check this with solar panels, when you orient them directly toward the sun, electric current output will be at max."
"It would be neat to see the moons orbital path in there also. In summer in the northern hemisphere, the moon moves from southeast to southwest (short) then in winter, the sun and moon switch,  and you could say the northern hemisphere gets more moon light, as it goes from northeast to northwest."
Does the moon orbit also have an effect on the seasons?
Your 365 days a year is incorrect as we have Leap Years for the extra 1/4 of a day more to make a year
What? It must be 365 days and 6 hours..
Yeah
"In January, the southern hemisphere has summer AND Earth is closest to the Sun. Antartica has 24 hours of sunlight. So if Science Academia tells you that the polar ice caps in Antartica are melting, in december through February, then you know that's just propaganda.  Same is true for the polar ice caps of the North Pole, during the months of May through July.  Of course the polar ice caps are going to shrink a little bit when they are getting 24 hours of sunlight....especially Antartica, during January because not only is Antartica getting 24 hours of sunlight, but Earth is also CLOSEST to the Sun during January; wuth the southern hemisphere tilted in toward the Sun on top of all that.  This is why I believe that much of the hype about climate change & global warming/cooling is political propaganda."
donaldb1 and also the sun hits somewhere by 90 degrees all the time and wherever that location currently is is surely very hot. A lot of people dont understand that the further north and south you go from where it directly hits the more atmosphere it has to go through so its not as strong
"The Arctic is an ocean that has thermal currents which bring warm water up to the arctic, while Antarctica is a continent, which is why it is colder.  Earth being about 3% closer to Sun in January than in July doesn't make much difference."
Excellent information
So.... the southern hemisphere is hotter during the summer versus the northern hemisphere during the same season (summer)?
@Katryn Wiese Isn't the southern hemsphere summer season hotter because it has more ocean so it has more heat
"No. The summer in the Northern Hemisphere (July/August) is hotter than the summer in the Southern Hemisphere (January/February) because of the differences in land vs ocean.   From http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/40-our-solar-system/the-earth/climate-and-weather/79-why-isn-t-the-summer-solstice-the-hottest-day-of-the-year-beginner  ""There is more land in the Northern Hemisphere, and more water bodies in the Southern Hemisphere. Now, land has a much lower specific heat capacity than water; in other words, water can hold a lot of heat while land cannot. Hence, land heats up faster and also cools off faster than water. So, during summer, the greater amount of land in the northern hemisphere is heated up quicker, while in the southern hemisphere, the water absorbs a lot of the heat and gets warmer by a much lesser amount. In any case, the result is that northern summers are hotter than the southern summers."""
January is the warmest for us Australians
Sun and planets are NOT in the same plane. Your model is erroneous.
"Some Guy   I’m sure you’re ignorant of the plane so I’ll tell you. The most a planet, not including Pluto, is off line with the sun’s equator is 7.15°"
Some Guy   But they are very close to the same plane. How much out are they? Approximately.
Some Guy  You're right but she's not talking about other planets though and neither are their orbits shown so how is that relevant?

"Correction, treeline at roughly 60 ° in Arctic, no trees in Antarctic, despite its closer proximity to sun. And water is more difficult to heat than rocks, (needs roughly twice the energy to achieve same temps as rock) so rocky Antarctic should hold sun heat better than icy water in North, heat the water around it even. No trees. Just anomalies. I'm not trying to make you wrong, just asking for more honesty around known and unknown and suggest a willingness to delay certitude when it can't be honest. Let's talk about anomalies."
"stratoblaster23   The Antarctic current is circular. Cold currents circulate around the continent. It is a continent, i.e. land. The Arctic is mostly water. The Arctic current flows from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The Gulf Stream bring warm water to the Northern Latitudes. There is more to the climates than just the perihelion of the sun."
"stratoblaster23   You fail to realise that axial tilt is not changing the distance from the Sun significantly, but drastically change the amount of surface accepting same amount of energy (compared to the amount of surface accepting equivalent amount of energy when Sun rays fall at 90 degrees angle."
"Considering our 23.4° tilt is responsible for seasons when sun is 93,000,000 away, this phenom of Antarctic summer with 24 hr sun and a 3.4% closer proximity to sun should, imho, render the south pole a tropical paradise (or burning desert) as the roughly 3 million miles closer is far more significant than the distance change due to axial tilt. Closer is hotter, to me, no matter how you slice it... And did you hide my comments? I don't see them in the regular feed."
Correct answer is 3.4%.
"from this site, they answer you (7%) but try to avoid the obvious problem.  ""Averaged over the globe, sunlight falling on Earth in January is about 7% more intense than it is in July. However, the northern hemisphere of Earth has more land, while the southern hemisphere has more water and that tends to lessen the impact of differences in sunlight between the closest approach and the greatest distance. Sunlight raises the temperature of land more than it does oceans. In July (at aphelion), the land-rich northern half of our planet is tilted toward the Sun. Aphelion sunlight is a little weaker than sunlight at other times of the year, but it nevertheless does a good job warming the continents. In fact, say climate scientists, northern summer in July when the Sun is more distant than usual is a bit warmer than the southern hemisphere summer when the Earth is closer to the Sun."" https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question53.html.   Note the ""Sunlight raises the temperature of land more than it does oceans"" part, as I said...and...they leave out mention of Antarctica in the answer and get a little squirmy around the Aphelion mention."
"Why is Antarctica so much colder than antartica? Doesn't make sense,  they should be equal temperature according to this"
"Ashley: the temperature of the Poles has to do with way more than how much direct sunlight. But you're correct in that if that was all that mattered, they'd be the same temperature. However, there are two major processes at work on the planet to redistribute heat from the equator to the poles: winds (air circulation) and currents (water circulation). Antarctica is surrounded and isolated by a current that wraps around it. Meanwhile, under the ice of Antarctica is rock, which has a low heat capacity. So as the ice is cold, so, too, is the rock. In the Arctic, under the North Rotational Pole, there is no land, only sea ice covering water, and that water has a huge heat capacity, so it is, effectively, a source of trapped heat keeping the under-ice area and air it contacts warmer than the ice itself."
Why don't we see different constellations every six months?
"Ashely,  We do see different constellations every three months (apart from the circumpolar stars visible all year long (from the same hemisphere). You should at least try to learn a bit about the stars, before you ask such meaningless questions."
"The Earth's tilted rotational axis points at roughly the same location in the universe: our north rotational pole points at Polaris, the north star, -- and is fixed (in our time frame -- over 10s of thousands of years it migrates a bit but for us we don't notice). You can see that in the images."

"It actually takes only 23 hours and 56 minutes for the earth to rotate once on its axis.  24 hours is the average length of time between successive solar noons, which is a bit longer than the time taken for one revolution."
How many bets do you reckon I’ve won with this question? Answer..heaps
Tubmaster 5000   But it is true. Sidereal days aren’t quite 24 Hrs.
"Technically it takes 24 hours for the Earth to turn once such that it faces back towards the Sun. However, in that time it has gone one degree in its orbit around the Sun. Turning once on its axis, such that it points back to the same point in space, takes some 4 minutes less, only 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds."
Just another astronomical movement of the earth that we don't feel lol
"Florence Gomer   A sidereal year is 366 days and our normal year is 365 days of 24 hours.  They both work out to the same amount of hours per year when you do the correct maths. So you are correct. There is a day difference, 24 hours."
Cary B ... And this explains why the stars change over the course of the year. Any particular star will reach the same position in the sky some 3 minutes 56 seconds earlier per day on successive days. This is around 2 hours earlier per month.  It is no coincidence that 365.25 times 3 minutes 56 seconds gives the answer as 24 hours.
Florence Gomer   Sidereal time of rotation. Yes!
"Awesome video, thanks a lot"
Best one thank for clearing the concept
Too gud presentation.absolutely loved it
hahahahahahah
this is so helpful
"I'm... Seriously stuck on the tilt. Is it the way the earth rotates? Is it the way the magnetic poles are? How is the tilt not an arbitrary thing? I just... See the earth. And what we call North is tilted. Totally lost on this, guys. I don't know what's wrong with my head."
"The tilt shown in the video is for the rotational pole only. The magnetic pole is a bit more complex and wanders around. And the tilt of the rotational pole is only relative to the solar ecliptic -- the plane of the solar system if you line up the planets and the Sun. From the reference point of the Earth, we don't feel tilted, but relative to the Sun, we are. Does this help?"
why doesnt 12 o'clock noon turn into midnight after 6 months then? think about it people...
Nope
"Jared,   You still think Earth rotates 360 degrees from noon to noon?!  Nope, you didn't googled it, or simply couldn't understand it.  Leap years are due to Earth not being aligned with the same 'spot' in it's orbit after 365 rotations.  You 'understood so man things so wrong, and you dare others to 'think about it'??!!!"

"Fred Cink, i googled it. that explains the extra day for every four years, not 12 hours every six months. nevermind; just keep googling stuff and NOT thinking about anything. 😩"
Okay so what you're saying is the amount of heat and the diameter of the Sun stays the same no matter how close or far away is in fact
"Not quite like that...  The heat, and observable diameter changes, but not drastically, because it is only 1.5% longer distance, so you need good telescope and careful observation to notice the difference in Sun diameter."
thanks for making me understand this things
How come they always show the Sun so big
"Brent: The Sun is 109 times wider (diameter) than Earth -- so it's much much bigger. But it's so far away from Earth that it looks small in the sky, taking up only about 5 cm in width when seen from Earth's surface.  In pictures, we cannot show both to scale and still see features on Earth (Earth would be a tiny point very very far way from the Sun). So all the pictures we show are NOT to scale, and we have to choose whether to show the sizes correct or the distances correct; we can't do both unless we can zoom. Best scaled version I know of is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR3Igc3Rhfg"
Brent Kathan  Actually the Sun is much bigger when compared to Earth size then that what is shown in the video.
"@4:00, the model shows in June, day and night are the complete opposite of day and night in December. The sunlight is coming from the center of the solar system.  Time(sunlight) would be the complete opposite from one side of the orbit to the other. Someone please explain"
OK. Thanks for the clarification. :)
"Earth Rocks!  Not correct.  Solar day is 24 hours.  Sidereal days i 23 hours 56 minutes.  Solar day is 361° of Earth's rotation. (the place that had noon on the Earth 24 hours ago, will again have noon)  Sidereal day is 360˘of Earth's rotation. (the place that was directly under specific star 23:56 hours ago, will be directly under that same star after 23:56 hours passed)"
"Marcus: I understand your question, and good for you for continuing to ask even when not getting a great answer. I tried to come up with a great answer for you, and it took so long and was so bad that I went online to find a better one, which is linked to at the end of this reply.  NOTE: When I can't come up with a clear good answer quickly, that's a good clue I don't understand it well myself!  In fact, you're correct! IF the length of a solar day was exactly 24 hours, we'd reverse day and night hours after 6 months, but a solar day is actually a few minutes less than 24 hours. Meanwhile, 24 hours is what humans defined as a day exactly to prevent the problem you described. Take a single location on Earth's surface, like San Francisco. Each solar day, the sun rises a few minutes later for that location. Over 6 months, that adds up exactly to 12 hours difference. But since we humans define our time schedule/clock day to be 24 hours, we are adding back those extra minutes each day -- we're catching up. And we defined our clocks and hours and time pieces precisely to prevent the problem you describe.

"Marcus,   Sorry but I think you are not asking it well.  If you put the clock on the equator it will show 12:00 every day at noon, no matter where is the Earth on it's path around Sun.  I am trying to understand why are you thinking the time would change during orbit, and only thing that comes to my mind is common misconception that the Earth rotates 360° around it's axis for one day, but that is not true.  One rotation around Earth's axis is called sidereal day, and Earth rotates for 360° and come to the same relative position regarding the background stars. It takes approximately 23 hours 56 minutes for that.  But after finishing one rotation, the point that was at noon (Sun directly above that position) when rotation started, would not be directly under the Sun, because Earth is also revolving around Sun and changes relative position to it.  Therefore, Earth rotates 361° around it's axis so that the same place where the noon was at the beginning of rotation comes under the Sun again. This is called solar day and it takes approximately 24 hours for that.  Is it any clearer now?"
"Marcus,  In the example of the runner, I simplified it to make it more understandable.  You can take same example, but now with the runner who run in circle and turn around it's axis, but it all stays the sam, every 'noon' his left arm will be pointing toward the Sun, no matter at what part of the track he is."
"Question please?, if earth's axes is always tilted at 23.5°, means this axes draws parallel lines that will never meet at a point, and so we shouldn't see Polaris always fixed at the north pole, kindly clear my confusion about this point."
There is also  the wobble  to take into account
"Polaris is just really far away, so even though the earth’s tilt changes, it doesn’t appear to move. Careful measurement shows it does though"
"Kha Tran (deleted comment),  Polaris is neither spinning around in circle parallel with Earth, neither other stars are spinning around Polaris.  Apparent moving of stars, planets, Moon and the Sun over the sky is due to Earth's rotation around its axis.  Polaris is positioned near Earth's rotational axis, and looks like it doesn't move, but after closer observation, it is visible that it is moving to, just in quite small circle, compared to other stars."
"Hassan,   Earth axis is not always the same, it changes gradually (one period is 23.000 years), but for our limited human life, it can be considered fixed.  Polaris is not fixed to North pole, but it is the brightest star position closest to Earth rotational axis.  Polaris is at the distance of 433 light years (433 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 300.000 km) or 4.09E15 km (4 with 15 0 before decimal point), from the distance of Polaris Earth doesn't move at all in its 150 million kilometers radius trajectory."
if you look up The Irregular s shape patterns of passive totality during the summer time and The Irregular s shape patterns of path of totality during the winter time you will understand that the sun is much more local during one season and add a farther rotation above us during another season all you would have to do is take the path of totality find out the cities closest to it and then put them on a Gleason map it will become very clear
Gleason map is equidistant azimuthal globe projection and doesn't reflect observable distances in real world.

How long does it take for the Moon to orbit the Earth? Does it orbit along the equator? It would be awesome to see an animation of that.
I used to watch a Satellite View channel and it showed Earth 24 hours a day... The Moon seemed to always be in the Northern Hemisphere's Tropic of Cancer region.
Just stay up all night every night for a month and look at the sky. Live animation in real time.
"It takes 29.5 days (what months are based on ultimately). To see animation of that, watch the videos I've created on Tidal Causes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMX--80J_5o"

@Harold Hourie I believe you didn't read the question properly :) 
" I mentioned angles! Edit: I misspelled the word heat, twice. Sorry for that. It might have confused you."
The number of sun rays are reflecting on to earth in each season at all times but it is because more square meters in summer they are hitting more per square meter. In the winter at sun rise and sun set in the sun rays are hitting the earth at a less direct way hence less heat.
"This  was  a  great  video .  Easy  to  understand  the  seasons  a little  bit  better .  What I  really  cannot  grasp  is, if  the earth  is constantly  rotating ,  how there can be  day  on  one  side  and  night  on  the  other .  There may  be  an easy  answer ,  but so far I  just  can't  figure  it  out .  Any help  would  be  appreciated . Thanks ."
"I think I understand your question now. If still curious, follow this link: and will point you now to this very good answer: https://www.quora.com/If-the-earth-is-rotating-around-the-sun-wouldnt-night-and-day-switch-every-six-months-as-the-planet-would-be-on-the-opposite-side-of-the-sun"
The Earth takes 365 days to travel around the Sun. The Earth rotates about its own axis once every 24 hours (1 day).
"Earth Rocks! Thank  you  for  your  answer .  I did in fact  know  the earth  took  24 hours  to travel  around  the  sun .  What  I  was so confused  about  was if the earth  was spinning  as it rotated  the sun. That  was  my  confusion  ,  Thanks ."
"Because it takes 24 hours for the Earth to rotate,  and thus wherever you are during an equinox, for example, you will rotate out of darkness into the sunlight and then under the sun and then away from the sun, and then after 12 hours of sunlight, you'll have rotated out of the sun's rays entirely and be on the dark side, but 12 hours later you'll have rotated back to the sunlight. Sunrise = rotating back to the Sun."
Explained in plain English.
"On each equinox over the last 10 years, the sun🌞 has been setting further south? Does this mean that the Earths 23* tilt is growing larger? It would explain the unusual weather patterns we're experiencing. What do you think?🤔"
"Rusty Woodpecker    I had a friend a few years ago who thought the earth tilt was changing so i went through and measured the horizon angle and azimuth of the sun at rise, set, and solar noon. and placed it on a  earth and compared the angle to where it would be if the tilt was 23.45... Again and again the sun has been in the precise correct spot.. ( example of angle checkhttps://imgur.com/gallery/VZpIv) .I have checked this so many times and verified that tilt has not changed. ( other than several meters every year...it has always moved a tiny bit...very small.)  I continue this here and there and the sun sets and rises right where it is supposed to be every time..exactly. It cannot be correct here and off where you are too. I can only tell you that i am using multiple compasses, ensuring no magnetic interference, and also doing the measurements with google mapped verified directions( i.e. compass headings verifying with landmarks and observation position) I do this on any day...not just equinoxes. I am trying to say i had to do this with much detail and verification to ensure accurate measurements. The earth tilt is still where it ""should"" be. You are doing something different from year to year, or your observation position is different making it seem to set at a different spot. . There are a lot of ""fear porn"" utube vids out there like ""flat earth"" trying to get people to click claiming a tilt change.  It is in no way happening.  No need to worry. If the tilt were changing it would be clearly and immediately noticed by every amateur astronomer in the world as the stars would all be at different positions too... not to mention everyone would notice the sun in the wrong position every day.   A shift in tilt resulting in a noticeable change in sun position over such a short span of time would also result in catastrophic devastation as in buildings falling and earthquakes and the lengths of daylight radically changing everywhere in the wold. One thing to verify the tilt is the same it to check the length from sunrise to sunset. if it has not changed from what it is supposed to be , then by geometric definition the tilt must still be the same. I could go on with the ways we can know for sure about the tilt, but i hope you can see how absolutely sure this is.  You can check today if the sun is in the right path in the sky for the tilt of 23.45 degrees by measuring the sunset angle/ compass heading (or rise)a\nd comparing it oi.e. timeanddate(dot)com for instance. Try to verify a true compass heading using a compass and a satellite(google earth) image using landmark and your position with a angle compass at home then check it outside.   ...just a note on using magnetic compasses...they can be deflected by any magnet or mass of steel ...also be sure to set your declination correctly. This is why a google map verification of your position with a known mark for a heading verification is important to ensure you are completely accurate.  I had a friend really freak out about this 5 years ago and it was difficult for him. I hope you are not going through worry and concern about this because it is not happening. I hope this helps."
I'm in Queensland Australia (Southern Hemisphere). My block faces west. The sun has set further south on both Winter & Summer solstices over the last 10 years. I know this due to valleys and peaks on the hinterland (2km W) were the sun sets. Both solstices set in particular valleys(V) 10 years ago. Now they set on the peaks(^) South of original position. Earth tilt has shifted without a doubt. And our weather is evidence of this.
"Are you experiencing this yourself? If so, what hemisphere are you in? What latitude? Yes, over time, a changing tilt would change where the sun sets, but I doubt you'd notice that over a 10-year period!"
Excellent
Where's the Moon? You should show it going around the Earth.
"MrBarnabas09   Yes, let’s show something that is totally irrelevant to the seasons."
Moon comes out during Halloween :)
"See video on Tidal Causes to see the Moon. In a video on Seasons, the moon distracts...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMX--80J_5o"
I hate winter. Lived in Minnesota my whole life and I can't stand cold and snow. If all goes as planned I will be moving to Phoenix this fall. I crave HEAT.
"Why trade one torture method for another? Move to California instead, much more comfortable weather"
Lukeamania well it’s been 120 here. I even get to wait until like 9:30 at night to run because it cools down to about 100
Nice.  My son was born on the summer solstice in 1990.
"the wooble has an effect on the seasons, although it takes longer for the wooble to effect the seasons because the seasons happen more often than the wooble..."
That's what I used to think  .they are not explaining quite right   the season causes by the earth going above And below the horizon of the sun  What is known as the elliptic  . As I said you need get different views. They not good on explaining it.
You forgot the 5th season.  Shark week!
No! Monsoon!
Your comment was way underrated lol.  Very good!
Very good explanation. Thank you for the refresher.
"nice, great"
Thnx...I . Really..Got it After watching ur vdo
"I have a question: the precession of the equinox means that the axial tilt of the earth varies 23,5 x 2 = 47 degrees in total over roughly 25.000 years. Would that mean that 12.000 years from now (or ago) summer and winter would be reversed?"
"@almarjyou That's exactly what you are doing, son. Where is the proof that the earth's spin is related to the precession of the equinox? Where is the proof that a calendar can 'correct' an astronomical event? Tell me. You have no valid arguments whatsoever."
@J. H-K lol! You love to ignore what's in front you. 🤦‍♂️ you can continue to be confuse like a flat earther.
Try again
@almarjyou So your explanation is invalid. You cannot seem to comprehend that the earths spin is UNRELATED to the precession of the equinox. And that therefor a calendar CANNOT correct it.
"@almarjyou The solar year refers to certain amount of TIME, which we have expressed in days, because we don't know any better. The amount of TIME in which the earth orbits around the sun remains the same, no matter what callendar you use, or how you express it."
Simply educating.. Good job !

Great video in its simplest form to understand.
Great explanation 👍 I born on EQUINIX😊 THANKS
Summer Solstice born right here
Yay! :)
So then why doesn't the suns gravity.. which is pulling earth along.. steal the moon during a solar eclipse. ... . The giant sun. That's even dragging. Pluto along should easily steal our moon..... yet it doesn't
The solar system is actually in balance meaning that the orbital velocities and masses of the planets counter the inward pull of the suns gravity perfectly resulting in a balanced system with no change!
"Actually, it does.  From: http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/98953.html If you trace the path the moon makes in space, it's a spiral around the sun.  The earth also orbits in a spiral because of the effect the moon's gravity has on our planet.  Since the earth is rather more massive than the moon, the moon moves more than the earth does in response to the gravitational attraction the two share, but both bodies orbit the sun."
The earth's gravitational pull on the moon is much stronger than the sun's because the earth is much closer to the moon than the sun is.  Gravitational pull declines exponentially as the distance between two objects increases.
Excellent job! Well done!
the voice mentions that Earth makes 365 rotations a day. 365 yearly rotations is clearer.
"Indeed! That sounds quite confusing. There is a script for this video here: https://fog.ccsf.edu/~kwiese/content/Classes/SeasonsScript.pdf. Here's what I actually say: ""As the Earth orbits the Sun, it goes through 365 daily rotations, while the axis maintains its tilt. "" So it's not actually saying 365 per day, though I see how it might sound that way. I'll work on that for next version. What this one says that in one year (1 orbit around the sun), it completes 365 rotations (1 per ""day""). Perhaps better would have been: As the Earth makes one complete orbit around the Sun, it completes 365 rotations around its axis, each of which is called a day."" Thanks for the feedback."
But the Earth has an elliptical orbit.
Doesn't the earth spin on its axis? Looks like a video from NASA.
"Yes, the Earth spins on its axis, which produces the 24-hour day. That's part of the video! Some of the animations are from NASA. :)"
Excellent presentation! Thank you so much...
Best video as far as I watched
"Hey I had always trouble understanding these completely. Now I have clearer mind, thank you!"
Me too but this was so helpful

"@manojkumar tummala ,God bless you with wisdom and knowledge to know the Truth dear brother👍🙏🙏."
"@AnandaRuth Kota I like the way you asked 😂. Let me explain you - Time is the most important factor in the creation of any geological structure. The above explained features too are geological structures created over time. So, time is the one which actually created these geological structures. Just being rational, thats it. I wish people put God aside for all practical purposes."

@AVINASH SUDHAGANI do you have any statistics to prove it
@AVINASH SUDHAGANI this is the first problem in India.. Without having any information blindly saying and talking about the plolitics.. Do you know anything about harithaharam in Telangana.. Currently all the villages in Telangana are having there own nursaries.. Because of that project now almost 5% of forest & green covered up.. For these kind of program people support must be needed.. sadly no one cares..

U could see the streets of pakistan almost 90% of men roaming around in thobe and most women in black blankets. and the motorcycle situation is a laughing stock. almost everybody still riding the same damn 70cc 2 decades old mopeds.

"We prepared completely biodegradable films using Cotton (cellulose), wheat protein isolate and soy protein isolate.  But the biopolymers are expensive,  lack sufficient strength and thermal resistance.  In order to overcome these limitations, we converted them into biodegradable composite films by reinforcing them with kitchen waste such as used tea leaf powder, used coffee powder, tamarind seed powder, egg shell powder etc.  We prepared them way back in 2009 and published our results in various International journals."
Please give opportunities for biodegradable plastic projects so that we can avoid plastic permanently.
Please implement immediately to avoid pollution and save environment.

"చూసారా అంత పెద్ద శాస్త్రవేత్త అయ్యి ఉండి కూడా ఆవిడ చక్కగా తమిళంలో మాట్లాడుతున్నారు. మన తెలుగు వాళ్ళకి చిన్న ఉద్యోగం వస్తే చాలు ఇంక ఆంగ్లంలో మాట్లాడేస్తారు. భాష మీద అభిమానం కనీసం అయినా ఉన్నా కూడా చాలా బాగుండేది. చాలా మంది కళాశాల విద్య పూర్తి చేసిన తరువాత కుడ తప్పులు లేకుండా తెలుగు రాయలేక పోతున్నారు. ఇంక నగరాల్లో ఆటో వెనకాల ఉండే పదాలు, యూట్యూబ్ తంబ్ నైల్స్ ఉండే బూతులు అన్నీ, ఇన్నీ కావు. కనీసం ఇప్పటినుండి రోజుకి కాసేపు తెలుగులో మాట్లాడేందుకు ప్రయత్నిస్తే భావి తరాలకు తెలుగును అందించగలం."
